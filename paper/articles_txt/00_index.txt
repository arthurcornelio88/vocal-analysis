  Summary: This study, focused on the laryngeal source level, introduces the concept of laryngeal vibratory mechanism.
  Human phonation is characterized by the use of four laryngeal mechanisms, labeled M0–M3, as evidenced by the electroglottographic (EGG) study of the transition phenomena between mechanisms with a population of men and women,

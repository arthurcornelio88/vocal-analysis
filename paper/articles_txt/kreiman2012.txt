Increases in open quotient are widely assumed to cause changes in the amplitude of the first
harmonic relative to the second (H1*–H2*), which in turn correspond to increases in perceived
vocal breathiness. Empirical support for these assumptions is rather limited, and reported
relationships among these three descriptive levels have been variable. This study examined the
empirical relationship among H1*–H2*, the glottal open quotient (OQ), and glottal area waveform
skewness, measured synchronously from audio recordings and high-speed video images of the
larynges of six phonetically knowledgeable, vocally healthy speakers who varied fundamental
frequency and voice qualities quasi-orthogonally. Across speakers and voice qualities, OQ, the
asymmetry coefficient, and fundamental frequency accounted for an average of 74% of the variance
in H1*–H2*. However, analyses of individual speakers showed large differences in the strategies
used to produce the same intended voice qualities. Thus, H1*–H2* can be predicted with good
overall accuracy, but its relationship to phonatory characteristics appears to be speaker dependent.

I. INTRODUCTION

Studies of voice typically focus on either production or
perception, but not usually both. In production studies, investigators image or otherwise measure movements of the phonatory apparatus, or approximate them with physical or
computational models, while in perception research investigators seek to measure what listeners perceive, or to uncover
acoustic correlates of particular vocal qualities. Few studies
have examined the perceptual consequences of changes in
glottal vibratory patterns or the physical precursors of
changes in perceived quality. One partial exception is the

relationship between the relative duration of the open part of
the glottal vibratory cycle [the open quotient (OQ)] and a
quality dimension ranging from “pressed” to “breathy” (e.g.,
Klatt and Klatt, 1990). An increase in OQ is widely assumed
to correspond to an increase in breathiness. This relationship
between OQ in the physical realm and perceived quality is
further assumed to occur because of changes in the relative
amplitudes of the first two harmonics of the voice source,
denoted H1–H2, or H1*–H2* when harmonic amplitudes are
measured from the audio signal recorded at the mouth and
then corrected for the effects of vocal tract resonances
(Hanson, 1997; Iseli et al., 2007).1 As OQ increases, energy
in the first harmonic (and thus H1*–H2*) is assumed to
increase, and this increase is the presumptive cause of the
change in vocal quality (e.g., Klatt and Klatt, 1990). Thus, the
relationship between H1*–H2* and OQ potentially provides a
linkage between descriptive levels along the “speech chain.”
Reasonable empirical support exists for the relationship
between changes in H1*–H2* and changes in perceived

quality (e.g., Hillenbrand and Houde, 1996; cf. Kreiman
et al., 2010b, who found that listeners could tell voices
apart—i.e., the voices differed in quality (ANSI, 1960)—as
H1–H2 changed in very small steps). The case is less clear
for the link between amplitude at the first harmonic frequency (H1) and OQ. The longer the vocal folds remain
open, the more closely matched the open phase becomes to
the period, leading to a stronger fundamental component in
the signal spectrum (assuming all other influences, including
pulse skewness, are constant) (Fant, 1995). However, empirical support for this relationship is rather limited. Most data
come from electroglottographic (EGG) or inverse filtering
studies of small groups of speakers, and reported relationships are not in general especially strong. In the most frequently cited study, Holmberg et al. (1995) correlated
harmonic amplitudes, estimated from acoustic spectra and
then log transformed, with EGG- and airflow-based measures of the adduction quotient (defined as vocal fold contact
time/period, or 1-OQ) for 20 female speakers. The two sets
of adduction quotient measures were only modestly correlated (r ¼ 0.57), and did not strongly predict H1*–H2* measures (r ¼ 0.46 for EGG measures, and r ¼ 0.69 for
airflow data, indicating less than 50% shared variance). Similarly, Swerts and Veldhuis (2001) inverse-filtered four
tokens of the vowel /a/ recorded from seven speakers, fitted
a Liljencrants-Fant (LF) source model (Fant et al., 1985) to
the data, and then measured OQ and glottal pulse skewing
(the LF model parameter RK) from the best-fitting model.
H1–H2 and OQ were positively correlated for 17/28 tokens,
negatively correlated for 4/28 tokens, and uncorrelated for
7/28 tokens (precise correlation values are not reported).
[See Huffman (1987) and Sundberg et al. (1999), for additional examples.] The same study also reported that while F0
is positively correlated overall with H1–H2, correlations for
individual speakers are variable, with 18 cases positively
correlated, 6 negatively correlated, and 4 with zero correlation (Swerts and Veldhuis, 2001).
Many more studies have examined the relationship
between harmonic amplitudes and glottal configuration in
the context of models of the voice source (e.g., Fant, 1995,
1997; Fant et al., 1985; Klatt and Klatt, 1990; Fujisaki and
Ljungqvist, 1986; Rosenberg, 1971). Several parametric
source models with varying complexities have been proposed, most of which model the shape of the glottal airflow
or its derivative in the time domain, based on observations
from airflow masks, electroglottographs, mechanical systems, and/or inverse filtering of speech signals. [Frequencydomain representations exist for only a subset of source
models; see, e.g., Fant (1995) or Doval et al. (2006)]. The
nature and extent of the relationship that exists between H1–
H2 and OQ varies across models. For example, in the LF
model the relationship is expressed as H1–
H2 ¼ 6þ0.27 exp(0.055 OQ) [Fant (1995), although Sundberg et al. (1999) report that Fant later stated that the fit of a
linear equation to the data was nearly equivalent]. In contrast, in the simpler KGLOTT88 source model H1–H2 is perfectly correlated with OQ (Klatt and Klatt, 1990). The
relationship between H1–H2 and OQ has also been shown to
vary within a single source model. Several authors (e.g.,
2626

J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 132, No. 4, October 2012

Swerts and Veldhuis, 2001; Doval and D’Alessandro, 1997;
Fant, 1997; Henrich et al., 2001) have demonstrated that in
the LF (Fant et al., 1985) and Rþþ source models (Veldhuis, 1998), the relationship between H1–H2 and OQ
depends on the extent to which the modeled glottal pulse is
symmetrical or asymmetrical. For example, Henrich et al.
(2001) showed that in the LF model H1–H2 is minimally
affected by pulse skewness when OQ is small; but as OQ
increases, the influence of skewness increases as well, so
that the range of possible H1–H2 values is more than 6 dB
when OQ ¼ 0.9; the precise value depends on the extent of
pulse skewness. The Rþþ model shows a similar effect
(Swerts and Veldhuis, 2001). Analyses of acoustic data
(Swerts and Veldhuis, 2001) confirmed the relationship
between H1–H2 and pulse skewness, which was a better predictor of H1–H2 than OQ was (25/28 tokens positively correlated). In contrast, as noted previously, H1–H2 is perfectly
correlated with OQ in the KLGLOTT88 source model (Klatt
and Klatt, 1990), in which pulse skewness is a constant
(Hanson, 1997; Henrich et al., 2001). Finally, current source
models are limited in their ability to match estimated pulse
shapes from a broad range of speakers and phonatory modes
(Henrich et al., 2001), so that the existence (or lack) of a
relationship in the context of a particular model does not
necessarily imply that the same relationship will exist in
other models or in natural data.
Finally, definitions of OQ vary from study to study,
because of differences in the manner of treating cases in
which the glottis never closes fully. Such cases may be
assigned an OQ of 100% (Hirano and Bless, 1993); OQ may
be calculated using the most-closed phase of the glottal cycle
(as in the present work); or the case may simply be omitted
from analyses (e.g., Fex et al., 1991). Because most women
produce phonation with a persistent glottal gap (e.g.,
S€odersten and Lindestad, 1990), these differences produce
substantial variance in the range and pattern of glottal pulse
shapes examined from study to study (e.g., Fant, 1995; Klatt
and Klatt, 1990; Holmberg et al., 1995; Hanson, 1997; Fex
et al., 1991).
In summary, despite the insights that modeling studies
have provided regarding the relationship between some
aspects of pulse shapes and acoustic attributes, questions
remain about the relationships that exist in natural data, so
that it is difficult to assess the adequacy of different source
models for explaining linkages between production and perception in voice. Studies to date suggest that the relationship
between H1–H2 and OQ may be variable, but model fit to
empirical pulse shapes is not such that definitive conclusions
can be drawn. Because existing empirical data are not sufficient to clarify this situation, this study examined the relationship between H1*–H2* (measured from recorded
acoustic signals), OQ, and the asymmetry coefficient (the
length of the opening phase relative to the open phase, e.g.,
Henrich et al., 2001; Shue and Alwan, 2010),2 measured
synchronously from high-speed video images of the vibrating vocal folds. Note that previous work on this topic has
used models of the glottal flow, which may differ in pulse
skewness from the glottal area functions measured here
(e.g., Howe and McGowan, 2007). However, these
Kreiman et al.: Glottal parameters in sustained phonation

differences in skewness should not affect measures of OQ,
which depend on glottal opening and closing instants, and
not on precise pulse shapes. By gathering multiple tokens
from male and female speakers who varied F0 and voice
quality quasi-orthogonally, it is possible to compare measures across a range of glottal area waveform shapes.
II. EXPERIMENT 1
A. Methods
1. Subjects and recording procedures

Six phonetically knowledgeable speakers (three female
and three male) with perceptually normal voices (as assessed
by a speech-language pathologist) participated in this experiment. They were asked to sustain the vowel /i/ (Draper et al.,
2007) for approximately 10 s while holding voice quality,
F0, and loudness as steady as possible, although vowel quality ranged from /I/ to approximately cardinal vowel /E/ due
to speaker response to the positioning of the laryngoscope in
the mouth. Across tokens, the speakers were directed to vary
F0 (low, normal, and high) and voice qualities (pressed, normal/modal, and breathy) quasi-orthogonally, resulting in a
minimum of nine tokens from each speaker. Because the
purpose of the quality and pitch variations was simply to
generate a variety of glottal configurations, no attempt was
made to ensure that they were produced in the same manner
across speakers.
High-speed video images of the vocal folds were
recorded during each utterance at 3000 frames/s (512  512
pixels resolution). A 70 rigid laryngoscope (KayPentax,
Lincoln Park, NJ) with a 300 W xenon light source (KayPentax, Lincoln Park, NJ) and a FASTCAM-ultima APX camera
(Photron Ltd., San Diego) were used to capture the images.
Audio recordings were collected synchronously with the
high-speed imaging. Synchronization was managed by the
signal acquisition software. Voice signals were recorded
with a Br€
uel & Kjær microphone (1.27 cm [1/2 in.] diameter;
type 4193 -L-004), held approximately 7 cm from the corner
of the speaker’s mouth, and were directly digitized at a sampling rate of 60 kHz (conditioning amplifier: NEXUS 2690,
Br€
uel & Kjær, Denmark; bandpass filtering of microphone
signal between 20 Hz and 22.4 kHz; analog-to-digital converter: voltage resolution 16 bits, input range 6 5 V). One
second of phonation was excerpted from the most auditorily
stable and representative portion of each token for subsequent analysis.
2. OQ and asymmetry coefficient calculations

Glottal events for each cycle were identified via frameby-frame examination of the high-speed images. For each token, in cases when glottal closure was complete, the first
instants of glottal opening and closing were identified and
marked by hand by the first author, with an approximate
interpolated resolution of 1/2 frame (0.17 ms). When the
glottis did not close completely, the moment when glottal
area began to increase and the onset of maximum closure
were treated as opening and closing instants, respectively.
For each individual cycle of phonation, OQ was calculated
J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 132, No. 4, October 2012

as the time from the first opening instant to the onset of maximum closure, divided by the time from the opening instant
to the opening instant of the following cycle. OQ equaled 1
only when the glottis never closed at all anywhere along its
length. To reduce measurement errors (which are assumed to
be random), OQ values were averaged over 100 ms windows, yielding ten estimates of OQ for each 1 s sustained
utterance.
Glottal area waveform skewness was calculated for each
cycle of phonation in the first 150 images of the glottal area
waveform data. Glottal area waveforms were generated from
high-speed images using custom software incorporating a series of edge-detection and region-growing algorithms. Factors including random noise in images, variations in contrast
levels, and multiple glottal gaps made area estimation from
complete 1 s recordings impractical; hence our decision to
limit these analyses to only 150 frames, which could be
checked by hand and manually adjusted if necessary for accuracy. After area calculations, the first instants of glottal
opening, the instants of maximum opening, and the onsets of
maximum closure were located, and the asymmetry coefficient was calculated.2
3. Acoustic measurements

Audio recordings were low-pass filtered at 8 kHz and
downsampled to 16 kHz prior to acoustic analysis. H1*–H2*
measures were extracted automatically from the audio signals using F0 values obtained from the STRAIGHT algorithm
(Kawahara et al., 1999). Harmonic amplitudes were calculated pitch synchronously using VOICE SAUCE software (Shue,
2009), with an analysis window of eight periods with a 1 ms
shift, corresponding to the resolution of the STRAIGHT output.
Values were not averaged across windows. The harmonic
magnitudes were then corrected for the effects of the first
two formant frequencies (and their respective bandwidths,
estimated for the entire 1 s window as described next) using
the formula in Iseli et al. (2007). Output was aligned with
the 50 ms window from the imaging signal for subsequent
statistical analysis.
Linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis systems produced significant errors in formant frequency estimation,
especially when the voice source was near-sinusoidal, when
a persistent glottal gap was present, and/or when F0 was
high. These factors, singly or in combination, increased the
prominence of H1 and led to its misidentification as F1. For
this reason, formant frequencies and bandwidths were
derived through analysis-by-synthesis. Using the UCLA
voice synthesizer (Kreiman et al., 2010a), the original voice
samples were copy-synthesized using the following procedure. Because apparent harmonic amplitudes can vary
depending on formant frequencies and bandwidths as well as
source characteristics, vowel quality was first matched to the
target, before the source was altered. Next, because LPCbased analysis techniques typically yielded variable (and
sometimes unrealistic) bandwidth values, all bandwidths
were calculated using the formant frequency-to-bandwidth
mapping function given by Hawks and Miller (1995) when
OQ (measured from the high-speed images) was 0.7.

B. Results

FIG. 1. H1*–H2* (in dB) vs open quotient (in percent), for all speakers and
utterances in experiment 1.

When OQ exceeded 0.7, an additional “open glottis” correction was applied. In these cases, following a suggestion by
Stevens (1998), calculated B1 was multiplied by a factor
ranging from 1 (when OQ ¼ 0.7) to 3 (when OQ ¼ 1.0).
Finally, the amplitudes of the first two harmonics were
adjusted to match the original target voice. Once the synthesized vowel matched the original recorded sample in vowel
quality and voice quality (so that in a pilot study using a
same/different task they were perceptually indistinguishable
to the first author, a phonetician), and the spectra of the original and synthetic tokens matched precisely as well, formant
frequencies and bandwidths were recorded and H1*–H2*
was recalculated using these values.3 Finally, H1*–H2* values were smoothed over time by fitting Legendre polynomials of degree three to the raw H1*–H2* values to reduce
the impact of occasional spurious values that arose in utterances with high noise levels and weak harmonic structures
(e.g., breathy, high-pitched tokens).

Cycle marking from images and audio files was validated by examining the correlation between F0 measures for
the two data sets. Values agreed almost perfectly across
speakers and tokens (r ¼ 0.997, p < 0.01). In the case of a
single token for speaker 2, acoustic F0 values showed a
period-doubling error. These data were excluded from all
subsequent analyses.
Figure 1 shows the relationship between H1*–H2* and
OQ for the complete subject group. These measures were
significantly but not strongly correlated (r ¼ 0.5, p < 0.01).
As noted previously, no effort was made to ensure that
the different speakers produced breathy, modal, and/or
pressed phonation in comparable ways, so that (for example)
one person’s modal phonation might resemble another’s
breathy or pressed. Despite this, previous studies relating
H1*–H2* and OQ to a voice quality continuum from breathy
to pressed predict that both these measures should decrease
with changes in quality along this continuum. Separate twoway analyses of variance tested this hypothesis for H1*–H2*
and OQ.4 A significant main effect of voice quality on H1*–
H2* was observed [F(2, 428) ¼ 121.50, p < 0.01]. However,
a significant interaction between speaker and quality [F(10,
428) ¼ 19.03, p < 0.01] also occurred, because no speaker
showed the entire predicted pattern of pairwise differences
in H1*–H2* (breathy > modal > pressed) across qualities
[post hoc Tukey tests; p < 0.01; Table I(a)]. OQ also varied
significantly with vocal quality [F(2, 428) ¼ 534.92,
p < 0.01), and interacted significantly with speaker [F(10,
428) ¼ 36.58, p < 0.01]. Results of post hoc Tukey comparisons for this interaction (p < 0.01) are given in Table I(b).
Note that for speaker 6, OQ for pressed phonation was significantly greater than that for modal phonation (p < 0.01),
contrary to predictions.
Figure 2 illustrates the differences among speakers that
underlie these variable relationships and the modest overall
correlations between H1*–H2* and OQ. As Fig. 2 shows, despite some outliers, H1*–H2* was approximately linearly
related to OQ for speakers 1, 2, and 5. The relationship was
categorical for speaker 6 (and possibly for speaker 5 as

well). For speaker 4, H1*–H2* varied with OQ only when
OQ exceeded about 0.8; and no significant relationship
between variables was observed for speaker 3 (Table II).
Next, multiple linear regression was applied to examine
the extent to which OQ, glottal area waveform skewness
(measured by the asymmetry coefficient), and F0 contributed
jointly to predicting H1*–H2* values. Because theoretical
work by Henrich et al. (2001) suggests that the importance
of the asymmetry coefficient in predicting H1*–H2* should
vary with OQ, three regression models were fitted to each
speaker’s data: One including phonatory cycles with OQ less
than an individually determined cutpoint, one including
cycles with OQ greater than this cutpoint, and one including
all data. Cutpoints corresponded to observed gaps in the distribution of OQ values for that speaker (OQ ¼ 0.7, 0.65,
0.82, 0.75, 0.65, and 0.7 for speakers 1–6, respectively; see
Fig. 2). These analyses included only data corresponding to
the first 150 images of each utterance, because the asymmetry coefficient was only measured for this interval.
Results of these regressions are shown in Table III,
which lists the standardized regression coefficients and R2

values for each speaker. Regression coefficients reflect the
relative importance of the different factors in predicting
H1*–H2* in that analysis. As Table III shows, speakers differed substantially in the extent to which each variable contributed to the prediction of H1*–H2* values. Speakers fell
roughly into three groups: Those for whom H1*–H2* was
best predicted by a weighted sum of OQ þ F0 (speakers 1,
3, and 5), those for whom OQ alone provided the best predictive model (speakers 2 and 4), and one speaker for whom
a weighted sum of the asymmetry coefficient þ F0 provided
the best model (speaker 6). OQ was the most important predictor for speakers 2 and 4, but was not significantly associated with H1*–H2* for speaker 6; and F0 was the most
important predictor for speakers 3 and 6, but was not a significant predictor for speaker 4. Finally, the theoretical prediction that asymmetry coefficients would be more strongly
predictive of H1*–H2* when OQ was large was true for
speakers 1, 3, and 6, but not for speakers 2, 4, and 5.
C. Discussion

These findings are consistent with theoretical work (e.g.,
Henrich et al., 2001; Swerts and Veldhuis, 2001) showing
that H1*–H2* variations cannot in general be predicted by
OQ alone. Contrary to predictions, however, the role of pulse
asymmetry varied from speaker to speaker, and F0 proved
the most important predictor of H1*–H2* for two of our six
speakers. These results suggest that speakers have several
different strategies available to them when varying voice

quality, and that the relationships between specific attributes
of the source spectrum and the voice production process are
more complex than sometimes assumed. We return to this
topic in the general discussion to follow.
This experiment raised a number of methodological
issues relevant to the study of spectral attributes of the
voice source. In particular, estimation of H1*–H2* was
highly sensitive to errors in formant and bandwidth estimation. Current LPC-based formant estimation methods cannot consistently detect F1 correctly if strong harmonics are
present at low frequencies. In addition, when F1 is near H1,
H1*–H2* cannot be unambiguously determined without
knowledge of bandwidths, but interactions between the
source and vocal tract make it difficult to estimate bandwidths without knowledge of glottal configuration. This
issue is further complicated by the lack of data regarding
bandwidths during open glottis conditions, which also limits modeling efforts.
In this study, we addressed these problems pragmatically by verifying formant frequencies using an analysis-bysynthesis procedure that constrained the order in which steps
were undertaken. Although this process was theoretically
motivated and resulted in consistent measurements, ambiguities remain in measured H1* and H2* values, particularly
when the glottis is open (as it often is in female or nonmodal speech). Empirical data regarding bandwidth modulations when the glottis is open are required to further clarify
the relationships among the variables studied in this
experiment.
In summary, despite these measurement issues, the present data suggest that listeners use a variety of strategies to
control H1–H2 (or H1*–H2*), so that the particular correlates vary across speakers and productions. However, in this
experiment, speakers varied voice quality statically across
tokens, and not within tokens. The demands of changing
from one phonatory state to another differ from those of initiating a particular kind of phonation from rest and then sustaining it, in ways that might affect the manner in which
phonation is controlled. To examine how variables co-vary
during dynamic changes in voice quality, in experiment 2 we
measured H1*–H2*, asymmetry coefficients, and OQ in a
speaker who varied voice quality from breathy to pressed
across a single utterance.

III. EXPERIMENT 2
A. Methods

Speaker 1 from experiment 1 (a female phonetician who
is experienced at manipulating voice quality) participated in
this experiment. Over the course of a 3.3 s utterance, she
changed phonation slowly from breathy to pressed while
holding F0 and vowel quality as steady as possible. Highspeed images and audio signals were recorded synchronously and analyzed for this utterance in the manner
described previously, except that asymmetry coefficients
were calculated for the entire duration of the utterance.
B. Results and discussion

Figure 3 shows how OQ changed over time for this
speaker and utterance, along with selected frames from the
corresponding high-speed images, and Fig. 4 shows how
H1*–H2* and the asymmetry coefficient varied with OQ
over time. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the speaker phonated with
a persistent glottal gap for approximately the first 2/3 of the
utterance (time 0–2.3 s). During this portion of the utterance,
OQ changed relatively little with changing quality, but the
size of the glottal gap gradually decreased, as shown in the
first three glottal images in Fig. 3(b). At the same time, glottal area skewness increased across this segment of phonation
(Fig. 4). When the glottal gap during the closed phase disappeared (as shown in the last two glottal images in Fig. 3(b)],
the speaker adjusted OQ more markedly as vocal
“pressedness” continued to increase from time 2.4 to 3.3 s.
Glottal area skewness decreased sharply at this point (Fig.
4). Regression analyses showed that in the presence of a
glottal gap (time 0–2.3 s, OQ ¼ 0.91–0.85), H1*–H2* was
best predicted by the asymmetry coefficient, with no significant contribution of OQ [Table IV; F(3, 19) ¼ 15.45,
p < 0.05; R2 ¼ 0.66]. In the absence of a glottal gap (time
2.4–3.3 s, OQ ¼ 0.84–0.58), H1*–H2* was best predicted by
OQ, with skewness making no significant contribution to
prediction [F(3, 6) ¼ 4.62, p < 0.05; R2 ¼ 0.55].5
IV. GENERAL DISCUSSION

The data in these two experiments underscore the
dynamic interplay between OQ, the asymmetry coefficient,

and F0 associated with H1–H2 values for a given vocal production, both across and within speakers and utterances.
Although causation cannot be determined directly from these
correlational analyses, in the context of the theoretical analyses and modeling results reviewed in Sec. I, it seems reasonable to conclude that speakers have a variety of strategies
available to them when varying voice quality. Although the
precise physiological mechanisms for achieving these goals
remain unknown, these include manipulations of glottal
pulse skewness, OQ, and/or glottal gap. Thus, the relationship between specific attributes of the source spectrum and
the voice production process is a complex one. Despite this
variety of phonatory configurations across speakers and
utterances, within speakers OQ, the asymmetry coefficient,
and/or F0 accounted for at least 57%, and as much as 93%,
of variance in H1*–H2* across utterances. These results
indicate that H1*–H2* is predictable, but that the predictive
models are speaker dependent.
It is not surprising that speakers would have a variety
of phonatory strategies available to them for manipulating

H1–H2 in speech. Listeners are highly sensitive to the relative
amplitudes of the lowest harmonics (Kreiman et al., 2010b),
which convey both paralinguistic information about a variety
of personal and interpersonal attributes [see Kreiman and Sidtis (2011) for review] and linguistic information in languages
like Gujarati (Fischer-Jorgensen, 1967), Chong (DiCanio,
2009), and White Hmong (Huffman, 1987). The ability to use
different movements to produce the same speech sound has
been described for the oral articulators (e.g., Guenther, 1994),
and in the case of phonation may arise from attempts to produce a particular quality, whether for linguistic or paralinguistic reasons, in the context of different combinations of
simultaneous pitch and/or loudness goals.
However, the variety of strategies implied by the results
also suggests that speakers may not directly control single
spectral attributes out of the context of the overall source
spectrum. H1–H2 can be manipulated by changing the amplitude of H1, but also by altering the slope of the harmonic
spectrum above H1 (so that H2 changes while H1 remains
constant). This suggests that examinations that focus solely
on H1 and H2 out of the context of other co-occurring spectral changes may risk misrepresenting the mechanisms
speakers employ to control overall spectral shape to reach
intended voice quality goals.
One significant limitation to this research is the accuracy/inaccuracy of bandwidth estimates. As noted previously, it is difficult to estimate formant bandwidths with
accuracy, particularly when the glottis is open. Although the
relationship between formant frequencies and bandwidths is
somewhat understood when the glottis is fully closed
(Hawks and Miller, 1995), a large percentage of phonation
occurs with glottal gaps, for both male and female speakers.

More research on the empirical effects of such gaps on bandwidths is essential for developing accurate techniques for
measuring harmonic amplitudes in natural speech.
In conclusion, this study provides data that both support
and contradict descriptions of the relationships among voice
quality, H1*–H2*, OQ, and glottal area waveform skewness.
Speakers appear to have several strategies available for varying voice quality along the breathy–pressed continuum,
including manipulating glottal gap, changing OQ, varying
F0, and altering the skewness of glottal pulses. Despite this
observed variability in phonatory configuration, OQ, the
asymmetry coefficient, and F0 accounted for the majority of
variance in H1*–H2* across utterances. Thus, H1*–H2* can
be predicted with good accuracy, but its relationship to phonatory characteristics is complex and speaker dependent.

H1–H2 can be measured in two ways—directly from the spectrum of the
voice source (usually obtained by inverse filtering or from a computational
model), or from the audio signal at the mouth after canceling the influence
of vocal tract resonances. This second method produces a measure designated H1*–H2*. No typographical convention exists to distinguish measures made directly from the spectrum of the glottal pulse from uncorrected
measures made from spectra of unfiltered speech, both of which are usually designated H1–H2. In this paper, we use H1–H2 to indicate measures
made directly from the spectrum of a glottal pulse, and H1*–H2* to indicate corrected measures made from the voice signal at the mouth. Note
that the speech pressure waveform measured in front of the lips can be
approximated by the time derivative of the volume velocity signal
(Rabiner and Schafer, 1978). This radiation effect is typically included in
the source function, i.e., the source signal is modeled as the derivative of
the glottal flow volume velocity.

Also sometimes called the speed quotient or pulse skewness and defined
as to/(to þ tc), where to is the duration of the opening phase and tc is the duration of the closing phase.

The analysis-by-synthesis process produced only a few estimates of H1–
H2 for each token. Calculated H1*–H2* values were used in their place to
provide better resolution for comparison to OQ measures. The two sets of
values were very well correlated (r ¼ 0.92, p < 0.01).

Preliminary analyses indicated no significant univariate relationship
between F0 and either OQ or H1–H2. F0 was therefore excluded as a
covariate in these analyses.

The same result occurs if data are divided at sample ¼ 17, which is the
breakpoint in the H1*–H2* data.

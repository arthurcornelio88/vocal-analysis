and from periodic glottal sources (Shadle, 1985; Stevens, 1993). The ratio of the amplitude
of the harmonics a t 3 kHz t o the noise amplitude in a 50-Hz band a t the same frequency
is 17 dB. Over the entire frequency range up to 5 kHz the noise spectrum is well below
the spectrum of the periodic source, so that the combined spectrum is expected to show
well-defined harmonics.
When the glottal area does not decrease t o zero over a cycle of vibration, the spectra
given by solid lines in Fig. 3.9 change in two ways. The spectrum amplitude of the periodic component becomes weaker at high frequencies, as noted above, and the amplitude of
the turbulence noise increases because of the increased flow. For a given subglottal pressure, the amplitude of the turbulence noise source at the glottis is expected t o increase
approximately in proportion to At.5, where A, is the average glottal area during a cycle
of vibration (Stevens, 1971). For example, the average glottal area during modal glottal
vibration in which the glottis is closed during a portion of the cycle is approximately
0.03 cm2 for an adult female. If a fixed glottal chink of 0.05 cm2 is added to this area, the
amplitude of the turbulence noise is expected to increase by about 4 dB. As noted earlier
in Table 3.1, however, the spectral amplitude of the periodic glottal source decreases by
about 13 dB a t 2750 Hz, giving a 17 dB decrease in harmonics-to-noise ratio in this frequency range. The two spectra now have the form given as dashed lines in Fig. 3.9, with
the noise spectrum being comparable to the periodic spectrum at high frequencies.
Numerous researchers have developed objective measures of the noise present in the
speech waveform during glottal vibration (see, for example, Yumoto et al., 1982; Ladefoged
and Antoiianzas-Barroso, 1985; Kasuya and Ogawa, 1986; Klingholz, 1987; de Krom, 1993;
Hillenbrand et al., 1994; Mori et al., 1994). Usually these methods involve isolating the
periodic component of the speech waveform from the noisy component. This can be done
through spectral- or cepstral-based analysis, or through comparing the pitch periods in
the time domain, measuring the differences between pitch periods that result from the
statistical variability of noise. However, as pointed out by Ladefoged and AntofianzasBarroso (1985), these methods do not measure just the noise that is due to an aspiration
source, but rather the noise that results from a combination of factors. These other factors
include jitter (changes in pitch) and shimmer (changes in amplitude of excitation). Their

glottis is closed over one-half of the cycle (solid lines), and a configuration in which the minim u m glottal opening is 0.1 cm2 (dashed lines). The spectrum for the periodic component gives
the amplitudes of the individual harmonics. The noise spectrum is the spectrum amplitude in
50 Hz bands. The calculations are based on theoretical models of glottal vibration and of turbulence
noise generation (Stevens, 1993; Shadle, 1985). (From Stevens and Hanson, 1995 and Stevens, in
preparation)

solution was to use only part of a vibratory cycle and compare it with the corresponding
part of the next cycle.
Klatt and Klatt (1990) suggest two problems with this waveform-based measure. First,
the waveform is dominated by the lower formants because they have a greater amplitude,
particularly F1, while aspiration noise occurs primarily a t high frequencies. This problem can be reduced by highpass or bandpass filtering. Second, unless the fundamental
frequency is an exact multiple of the sampling period, even a perfectly periodic waveform
will appear aperiodic, due t o frequency components near the Nyquist frequency that are
represented by only a few samples. This can only be remedied by significant oversampling.
To quantify the noise component in relation t o the periodic component, we have chosen
t o define a harmonics-to-noise ratio as the ratio of the level of the harmonic with the
greatest amplitude in the third-formant region (for a nonretroflexed vowel) to the level
of the aspiration noise in the same region, both levels being measured from the spectrum
calculated with a 22.3 ms hamming window (bandwidth of about 90 Hz (Rabiner and
Schafer, 1978)). Of course, it is not possible t o separate the noise from the periodic
component and to measure each separately. However, the harmonics-to-noise ratio can
be determined for vowels synthesized with a formant synthesizer that contains a periodic
glottal source and an aspiration noise source.
Figure 3.10(b) shows the spectrum of a synthesized vowel /ze/ with formant frequencies
and fundamental frequency at values appropriate for an adult female speaker, but with no
aspiration noise. Above this spectrum, in Fig. 3.10(a), is the spectrum of the same vowel
when the sound source is continuous aspiration noise with a suitably shaped spectrum.
The level of this aspiration at 3 kHz, the frequency of the third formant, is 8 dB below the
level of the highest harmonic in the F3 region in Fig. 3.10(b), also a t 3 kHz, in a 90-Hz
band. When the two are mixed, the result is the spectrum in Fig. 3.10(d). The harmonicsto-noise ratio for this composite spectrum is defined to be 8 dB. (In the synthesizer, the
noise amplitude is modulated by the glottal source, so that the harmonics-to-noise ratio
as just defined refers to the peak level of the noise during the glottal cycle.) Fig. 3.10(c)
displays the spectrum of the same vowel synthesized with an additional tilt (10 dB) in
the periodic glottal spectrum. The level of aspiration (Fig. 3.10(a)) a t 3 kHz is now

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

42

about 2 dB above the level of the highest harmonic in the F 3 region in Fig. 3.10(c). The
spectrum of the vowel synthesized with both sources is shown in Fig. 3.10(e), and the
harmonics-to-noise ratio for this combined spectrum is defined t o be -2 dB.
Figure 3.8 shows the effect of turbulence noise at the glottis in the spectrum of a
natural vowel. The harmonic structure of the spectrum in Fig. 3.8(b), which has a more
extreme tilt, becomes less apparent a t high frequencies (2.5 kHz and above), presumably
because of the effect of the aspiration noise.
The influence of aspiration noise can also be seen by examining a vowel waveform
when it is bandpass filtered a t F3, with a bandwidth of 600 Hz. The two F 3 waveforms
corresponding t o Figs. 3.10(d) and 3.10(e) are shown in Figs. 3.10(f) and 3.10(g). The
effect of a 10 dB difference in the harmonics-to-noise ratio is clear. The waveform in
Fig. 3.10(f), while showing signs of noise excitation, still has a periodic nature. However,
the waveform in Fig. 3.10(g) shows mainly noise, with much less evidence of periodic
excitation.
T h e technique of estimating the amount of noise in relation t o the periodic component
by examining the bandpassed waveform in the F 3 region, such as those in Figs. 3.10(f)
and 3.10(g), has been used by Klatt and Klatt (1990). It is also possible for an observer
t o make estimates of the amount of noise in a spectral representation, such as those of
Fig. 3.8. The observer makes estimates of the amount of noise on a scale from 1 t o 4,
where 1means there is essentially no evidence of noise interference and 4 means that there
is little evidence of periodicity. Separate estimates are made from the waveform and from
the high-frequency part of the spectrum.
To relate these scaling methods t o the physical characteristics of the stimuli, we have
made a set of judgments for a series of synthesized vowel stimuli. These synthetic vowels
were generated with known amplitudes of aspiration noise in relation to the periodic glottal
source, so that the harmonics-to-noise ratio of the stimuli are known. Stimuli of the type
shown in Figs. 3.10(d) and Fig. 3.10(e) were synthesized with several amplitudes of the
aspiration noise source and with several amounts of spectral tilt. The spectrum for each
vowel was generated, and two judges independently rated the noisiness of these spectra
on a scale from 1 to 4, following the procedure described by Klatt and Klatt (1990).

in the left column and -2 dB for the vowel in the right column.

Thus for each stimulus we have a measure of the harmonics-to-noise ratio and we have
average judgments from the observers based on the spectrum. Figure 3.11 shows a plot
of the harmonics-to-noise ratio vs. average noise judgments for these synthesized vowels,
including a straight line that has been fit to the data. Using this plot, judgments for
synthetic stimuli can be related to similar judgments for spoken vowels, as discussed in
Section 3.3.3.

3.2.3

Summary of theoretical background

We have discussed several ways in which the configuration of the vocal folds and glottis
may vary during vowel production. Specifically, we have considered four types of configurations: (1) the arytenoids are approximated and the membranous part of the folds close
abruptly; (2) the arytenoids are approximated, but the membranous folds close nonsimulta,neously along the length of the folds; (3) there is a fixed bypass airway, or "chink," a t
the arytenoids, but the folds close abruptly; (4) both the vocal processes and arytenoids
remain abducted throughout the glottal cycle, forcing the folds t o close nonsimultaneously. Through a combination of observation and modeling, we have suggested several
ways in which these various configurations affect the glottal airflow and are manifested in
the speech spectrum or waveform. Note that there may be other glottal configurations in
addition to the four that we have considered.
As a result of the theoretical discussion, we have suggested several measures that can
be made directly on the spectra and waveforms of natural vowels and that may give some
indication of the vocal fold and glottal configuration during vowel production. A summary
of these measures follows:

A change in open quotient affects the spectrum mainly at low frequencies, so the difference in amplitude of the first two harmonics, H1 - H2, should give some measure
of OQ.
There are several sources of change in the spectral tilt of the voicing source: increases
in speed quotient, or skewness of the glottal pulse, presence and size of posterior
glottal chinks, and nonsimultaneous closure of the membranous part of the vocal
folds all lead to decreases in the abruptness with which the airflow through the

45

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

46

glottis is cut off. Decreases in this abruptness lead to increases in spectral tilt.
These increases in the tilt of the glottal source spectrum are most evident at midto high frequencies, so we will use the difference between the amplitude of the first
harmonic and the amplitude of the third formant peak, H I - A3, as a measure of
spectral tilt.
The presence and size of a posterior glottal opening affects the first-formant bandwidth. These increases may be observed in both the speech waveform and spectrum.
In the waveform the oscillations due to the first formant damp out more rapidly, and
in the spectrum the amplitude of the F1 peak is reduced. Thus, we will use two
measures of F1 bandwidth: one an estimate of the decay rate of the F 1 waveform
oscillation, and the other the difference between the amplitude of the first harmonic
and the amplitude of the first formant peak, H1 - A l .
Finally, the high-frequency noise content of the speech waveform and spectrum will
increase as the size of a posterior glottal opening increases. This noise will be estimated using subjective ratings of noise in the F 3 waveforms (Klatt and Klatt, 1990)
and in the spectrum. These ratings can be related to harmonics-to-noise ratios using
Fig. 3.11.
The theory predicts relationships between these measures in some cases, particularly
under conditions where the glottis does not close completely during some part of the
vibration cycle. For example, we see in Table 3.1 that as the area of the glottal chink
increases, both the F 1 bandwidth and the spectral tilt are expected to increase, and we
also expect the strength of the noise source to increase.
In the remainder of this chapter we describe some data that were collected for 22 female
speakers, and we attempt to interpret these data in terms of the theoretical models.

3.3

Experimental data

3.3.1

Speakers and speech material

We collected recordings of a number of utterances from 22 adult female subjects in the age
range 22 to 49 years. The speakers showed no evidence of voice or hearing problems, and

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

47

all were native speakers of American English. The utterances consisted of three nonhigh
vowels, /ze, E, A / , embedded in the carrier phrase "Say bVd again."

Each utterance

was repeated five times, with the 15 sentences presented in random order during a single
session. All the utterances were low-pass filtered at 4.5 kHz, digitized with a sampling
rate of 11.4 kHz, and stored for further analysis.

3.3.2

Measurements

The acoustic measurements summarized in Section 3.2.3 were extracted from these utterances in the following manner:

First-formant bandwidths. For all repetitions of the vowel /ze/ the first-formant bandwidth during the initial part of the glottal cycle was estimated from the rate of decay
of the waveform. The rate of decay was determined from the change in the peak-topeak amplitude in the first two cycles of the F 1 oscillation, using Eqn. 3.3. Estimates
were made for eight consecutive pitch periods in a relatively stable portion of the
vowel, generally a t the middle. To reduce interference by the second formant, the
waveforms were bandpass filtered with a filter having a bandwidth of 600 Hz centered
a t the first formant frequency. These 40 estimates were then averaged to obtain a
mean value for each speaker. This analysis was restricted to the vowel /a?/ because
for this vowel, the first formant is usually high enough so that two oscillations of the
formant waveform occur during the closed part of the glottal vibratory cycle, and
the second formant is well separated from the first.

HI* - H2*. The difference between the amplitudes of the first and second harmonics was
measured for all repetitions of all three vowels. For /z/, H1 - H2 was measured from
the spectrum obtained by centering a 22.3 ms Hamming window during the initial
part of the glottal cycle, a t the eight points where the F 1 bandwidth was estimated.
For / A / and /E/, the measurements were taken a t three points in midvowel, 20 ms
apart, where the formants were relatively stable. Corrections were made for the
amounts by which H 1 and H2 are "boosted" by the first formant,' yielding the
measure H l * - H2*. This corrected measure can be compared across vowels and
Correction given in Appendix A.l

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

48

across speakers. The values for each repetition were averaged to obtain a mean
value for each vowel for each speaker.

H l * - A l . The difference between the (corrected) amplitude of the first harmonic and
the amplitude of the first formant peak ( A l ) was measured. A1 was estimated by
measuring the amplitude of the strongest harmonic of the E l peak. The measurements were taken a t the same points as those for HI* - H2*, and similarly, average
values were computed for the three vowels for each speaker.

HI* - A3*. The difference between the amplitudes of the first harmonic and the third
formant peak (A3) was measured. As was done for A l , A3 was estimated using the
strongest harmonic of the E3 peak. H1 was corrected as above, and A3 was corrected
For
for the effect of E l and F2 on the spectrum amplitude of the third f ~ r m a n t . ~
this normalization F 1 and F2 were set to 555 and 1665 Hz, respectively, based on the
average F 3 measured for all speakers. As mentioned earlier, A3 is also dependant on
the bandwidth of E3. House and Stevens (1958) measured F 3 bandwidths of male
speakers for /z, A, r/ t o be 103,64, and 88 Hz, respectively. In dB this means that

/z/is expected to have an F 3 amplitude that is 4 dB less than that of / A / , while
that for /E/ is 3 dB less. For females speakers, the bandwidth values will be higher,
but because data are not available for these vowels for female speakers, we made
corrections based on the male data. This use of male data should result in minimal
error because the ratio between the bandwidths is used to compute the difference
in dB and this ratio is not expected to be very different across gender. Thus the
value of A3 measured for each token of /z/ and /E/ was increased by 4 and 3 dB,
respectively. The combination of these two corrections, for the location of F 1 and
F2, and for the F3 bandwidth, yields a normalized HI* - A3*.
Noise ratings. All repetitions of the three vowels were bandpass filtered around F3 us-

ing a filter having a bandwidth of 600 Hz. The bandpass filtered waveforms and the
speech spectra corresponding t o the speech segments used in the previously described
measures were given ratings for noise, as described in Section 3.2.2.3. These judgCorrection given in Appendix A.2

ments were made independently by two judges, who did not know which waveforms
or spectra corresponded t o which speaker. Their average ratings were highly correlated ( T > 0.92) and were averaged to obtain two noise judgments for each speaker,
one based on the waveforms and the other on the spectra. The waveform-based
ratings were found to be well correlated with the spectrum-based ratings. Analysis of variance showed a significant difference between the two methods ( F = 64,
p = 8.1 x

for the vowel /&/. For / A / the results for the two measures were

almost the same (F = 4.9, p = 0.04). For /z/ there was no significant difference
( F = 0.08, p = 0.39).

Results

3.3.3.1

Mean values

The mean values of the acoustic measurements for each speaker are summarized in Tables 3.2-3.4. Minimum and maximum values for each measure across speakers are given in
boldface in these tables. HI* - H2* has a range of about 10 dB, corresponding roughly to
a 40 percent range in open quotient (see Fig. 3.1). H I * - A3* has a range of about 26 dB,
indicating a wide variation in spectral tilt among the subjects. This large range of spectral
tilt is assumed t o be a consequence of the presence of a glottal chink or a nonsimultaneous
closure along the length of the glottis, or both, for some speakers. The minimum value of
tilt is 8.6 dB, about what might be expected for the case where there is complete, abrupt
glottal closure during some part of the glottal cycle (see Section 3.2.1). The range of

H l * - A 1 is 16 dB, as predicted earlier, and the minimum and maximum values are very
close t o those predicted in Section 3.2.2.1, -11 and 5 dB. The range of values obtained
suggests that first formant peaks vary from being very prominent for some speakers t o
being highly damped for others, although part of this range can be due t o variation in the
amplitude of H 1 and how well F1 is centered on a harmonic across speakers. This range of
first-formant amplitudes presumably arises in part due t o a range of F1 bandwidths and
in part due t o differences in the degree to which spectral tilt extends to the low frequency
harmonics.
The first-formant bandwidth estimates for /ze/ vary from 53 Hz t o 280 Hz. For the

speaker with the lowest value of bandwidth (53 Hz), this estimate is about what is expected
for the closed-glottis condition (Fant, 1972). For speakers with higher values of bandwidth,
losses must exist a t the glottis. Theoretical analysis of glottal losses indicates that a firstformant bandwidth of 280 Hz corresponds t o a minimum glottal opening of about 0.09 cm2
(see Table 3.1), while 75 Hz corresponds t o about 0.01 cm2, so we have a range of glottal
chink cross-sectional areas of about 0.08 cm2. The noise judgments range from 1.0 t o 3.8;
that is, some of our speakers show little to no noise in the high frequency range, while
other speakers have substantial noise.
3.3.3.2

Statistical analysis

Analysis of variance was performed for all measures (except B1) to examine differences in
parameter values among the different vowels. The results are summarized in Table 3.5. As
seen in the table, across all vowels HI* - H2* and H l * - A3* were found t o be significantly
different (p < 0.05). However, post-hoc analysis of variance for each vowel pair showed
that the differences were significant only when comparing /a/and /A/. Thus, it would
seem that the corrections made t o HI, H2,and A3 for vowel quality (see Section 3.3.2)
were largely successful in minimizing differences across vowels. However there may be some
effects of vocal-tract configuration on the glottal waveform that would lead to differences
across vowels (Bickley and Stevens, 1986, 1987).

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

Table 3.6 shows Pearson product moment correlation coefficients for the various measures for each vowel, while Table 3.7 shows the correlation coefficients for the three vowels combined. In the following discussion we consider a correlation with r greater than
or equal to 0.70 t o be strong. The strongest correlation was found between the highfrequency noise ratings and the tilt measure, H l * - A3*. As mentioned earlier, this is not
unexpected given that both tilt and noise are expected to increase with the area of a fixed
glottal opening (see Table 3.1 and the discussion in Section 3.2.2). H l * - A1 also has
a strong correlation with the spectra-based noise ratings. Again, this is predicted from
earlier discussion (see Table 3.1 where B1 increases with Ach). For the vowels /A/ and
/E/,

HI* - A3* is well correlated with H l * - A l , but the correlation is only moderate for

/=I. Finally, the correlation between Hl* - A1 and estimated F1 bandwidth for /z/ is
moderate.
It is striking that H l * - H2* is not well correlated with any other measure ( r < 0.59).
One might expect a larger open quotient t o lead to greater losses and noise due to an
increase in average glottal area. Although one might interpret this t o mean that H l * - H2*
is not a good measure of open quotient, Holmberg et al. (in press) have found HI* - H2* t o
be well correlated with open quotient in simultaneous observations of airflow and acoustic
spectra for female speakers. Therefore it may be that open quotient is nearly independent
of other glottal parameters. For example, a speaker may adjust her glottal configuration
in such a way that a larger open quotient results while rate of decrease of flow a t glottal
closure remains nearly the same. Thus HI* - H2* increases, but the tilt may stay nearly
the same, changing only a small amount due t o a change in the skewness of the glottal
pulse (speed quotient).
For the combined vowels, the noise measures are strongly correlated ( r > 0.70) with
the tilt measure, and the spectra-based noise measure is strongly correlated with the
H l * - A1 (BW) measure. In addition, HI* - A1 has a fairly good correlation ( r = 0.68)
with the tilt measure H l * - A3*.

Interpretation of acoustic measurements

In order to gain a better understanding of the correlations reported in Table 3.7, and t o
perhaps be able t o interpret the acoustic measurements in terms of glottal configurations,
we examined scatterplots of measures that were well correlated with each other.
Figure 3.12(a) plots H l * - A3* against H l * - A l . Almost all of the data points with
HI* - A1 less than about -6 dB have an HI* - A3* measure less than about 23 dB,
while all of the data points with HI* - A1 greater than about -2 dB have an H l * - A3*
measure greater than about 23 dB. Note that the highest H l * - A3* measure expected
for speakers with a posterior glottal opening and simultaneous closure of the membranous
part of the folds is about 25 dB (see Section 3.2.2.2). Based on this observation, we divided
the d a t a points into two groups, depending on whether HI* - A3* was less than or equal
t o 23 dB (Group 1) or greater than 23 dB (Group 2). Analysis of the two groups revealed
that for 19 speakers, all three data points fell into either one group or the other, but not
both. Data points for the other three speakers (F10, F 1 2 , F 1 7 ) fell into both groups.
Because subjects F 1 0 and F 1 2 had only one point each in Group 1, they were assigned
t o Group 2. Speaker F17 had two points in Group 1, so she was assigned t o that group.
Figure 3.12(b) shows a second version of Fig. 3.12(a) where d a t a points for Group 1
speakers are represented by closed circles and those for Group 2 are represented by open
circles. From Fig. 3.12(b), we see that the 11 speakers in Group 1 have relatively low

values of HI* - A3* and HI* - A l . That is, speakers in this group have shallow spectral
tilts and prominent first-formant peaks. Therefore, this group can be hypothesized t o
have abrupt glottal closures. Some speakers may also have posterior glottal chinks, which
would account for the range of HI* - A3* (about 15 dB) and H l * - A1 (about 11 dB)
that is present.
Speakers in Group 2, indicated by open circles, have much higher values of HI* - A3*,
that is, steeper spectral tilts. From these values, we surmise that the glottal closure
is not simultaneous along the length of the membranous part of the vocal folds. This
nonsimultaneous closure is probably due to the glottis being spread at the vocal processes,
although the folds could also close nonabruptly when the vocal processes are approximated.
The higher values of H l * - A1 for Group 2 speakers are due t o two influences on A l :
(1) the first formant has an increased bandwidth because there are greater losses associated
with the glottal configuration in which the vocal processes are spread, and (2) the spectral
tilt is so steep that its influence extends down into the first-formant range. There is no
upward trend between H l * - A1 and H l * - A3* for Group 2. This may be because for
these speakers, the source spectral tilt and the prominence of the first-formant peak are
influenced by both posterior glottal opening and nonsimultaneous closure, but the effect of
the nonsimultaneous closure is independant of the effect of the posterior glottal opening.
From Table 3.1 we see that if the bandwidth of the first formant ( B l ) is expressed
on a log (dB) scale, then B1 and H l * - A3* should increase together with a slope of 1
for speakers who have abrupt glottal closure. In Fig. 3.12(c) a line with slope 1 has been
drawn through the data and is seen t o fit nicely with the Group 1 points. This result is
evidence that Group 1 speakers have abrupt glottal closure and posterior glottal openings
that range in size across speakers.
Figure 3.13 shows the relation between the two types of noise judgments and the tilt
parameter HI* - A3*. Recall that there was a high correlation between these quantities.
This figure is also divided into the two groups of speakers of the previous figures. Speakers
with greater degrees of tilt show greater amounts of noise in their speech signals, as
predicted from the theoretical discussion earlier in this chapter. From Fig. 3.11, we see
that noise ratings of 2 and 3 correspond to harmonics-to-noise ratios of about 2 and

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

59

-10 dB, respectively. For about half of our female speakers, then, the harmonics-to-noise
ratio in the third-formant range was greater than 2 dB. A regression line ( r 2 = 0.62) has
been drawn through the points in Fig. 3.13.
In Fig. 3.14 the parameter H l * - A1 is plotted against F 1 bandwidth (on a log scale)
as measured in the first part of the glottal cycle for the 22 speakers producing the vowel
/z/.The d a t a are presented t o indicate which points belong t o Group 1 and Group 2

speakers. A line of slope 1is drawn through the d a t a t o represent the relationship expected
based on the theoretical development. There seems t o be a trend toward a decrease in F 1
prominence (that is, a decrease in A l ) as the F 1 bandwidth increases, but the correlation
is only moderate ( T = 0.61, p < 0.01). The relatively weak correlation may be due to the
fact that the prominence of A1 depends on the entire glottal cycle, whereas the bandwidth
measure is based only on the closed (or minimum glottal area) part of the glottal cycle.
Thus, A1 is influenced by the open quotient and the glottal aperture during the open
phase, but the F 1 bandwidth measure is not. In addition, other factors, such as spectral
tilt, may reduce A l . In fact, given these influences, it is not surprising that the Group 1
d a t a in Fig. 3.14 appears t o be better correlated than the Group 2 data.
For one speaker (F13) the bandwidth is sufficiently small (53 Hz) that complete glottal
closure can be assumed during a portion of the glottal cycle. This speaker is from Group 1.
For speakers with higher bandwidth and Hl* - A1 measures, it is reasonable t o assume
that the source of loss is an incomplete glottal closure. Two speakers from Group 2
( F 3 and F 8 ) have fairly narrow bandwidths (94 and 97 Hz), although this would not
be expected given our hypothesis that Group 2 members have abduction a t the vocal
processes. The HI* - A1 measure for these speakers indicates that A1 is indeed quite
prominent, consistent with the narrow bandwidth. The findings for these speakers may
indicate that their glottal closure is characterized by adducted vocal processes with no
posterior glottal chink, but nonsimultaneous closure within t h e membranous portion. This
interpretation might explain the narrow first-formant bandwidths, and consequently, high
first-formant amplitudes, and steep spectral tilts that these two speakers exhibit.

Summary

In the earlier part of this chapter we gave theoretical background describing how glottal
characteristics may be manifested in the speech spectrum or waveform. As a result of this
theoretical development, we suggested several measures to be made on the spectrum and
waveform that might be suitable for obtaining glottal parameters. We also predicted how
some of these measures might be related, and gave ranges of values that might be expected
in natural speech of females. These measures were then used to analyze the steady state
portion of vowels excised from the speech of 22 female subjects.
The results show substantial individual differences in several of the parameters. These
differences are in line with the ranges that were predicted in the theoretical development.
In particular, minimum values of the tilt measure H l * - A3* and the waveform-based
bandwidth measure B1 are very close to those predicted. The maximum value of B1 is close
t o that derived from minimum (DC) airflow measures that have been reported (Holmberg
et al., 1994), and the maximum value of H l * - A3* measured seems reasonable given
our earlier discussion. The range of values obtained for the spectrum-based bandwidth
measure HI* - A1 is the range that was predicted, and the minimum and maximum
values are within 1 dB of those predicted. In addition, several of the acoustic measures
are correlated as predicted from theory. The tilt measure HI* - A3* and the noise ratings
Nw and Ns are strongly correlated. H l * - A3* is also relatively strongly correlated with
one of the first-formant bandwidth measures, H l * - A l , and the noise ratings also tend
to have a good to strong correlation with H l * - A l .
Using the acoustic measures, we were able to divide the 22 subjects into two hypothetical groups. Group 1, with 11 speakers, is hypothesized t o have abrupt glottal closure.
Based on the measure B1, one speaker in this group seems t o have complete closure during
some part of the glottal cycle. The other speakers have larger B1 values, and thus are
thought t o have some losses at the glottis due to glottal chinks. The ranges of values
obtained for the two bandwidth measures, the tilt measure, and the noise ratings, suggest
that the glottal losses, and thus the size of these glottal chinks, vary from subject t o subject. In Section 3.2.2.2 we suggested that 16 dB might be a maximum value expected for
additional tilt due to a glottal chink, and, in fact, the additional tilt observed for speakers

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

63

a t the extreme for this group is about 15 dB. The maximum B1 that would be predicted
given this amount of additional tilt is about 225 Hz (see Table 3.1), while the maximum
B1 measured for this group is about 210 Hz.
Group 2 also includes 11 speakers, and due to their higher values of additional tilt, we
assume that these speakers have both glottal chinks and nonsimultaneous closure of the
membranous part of the folds. The generally higher B1 measures suggest greater losses
a t the glottis, rob ably due to a fixed opening that extends t o the vocal processes, which
would cause the nonsimultaneous closure. However, two members of this group have fairly
narrow first-formant bandwidths and lower HI* - A1 measures, suggesting that these two
speakers may have a glottal configuration consisting of approximated vocal processes,
nonsimultaneous closure, and, possibly, a glottal chink.
Our results are satisfying in that the ranges of observed values and the relationships
between these values are in line with the predictions based on our theoretical development. However, these results and our interpretation of the data have raised additional
questions, prompting further investigation. First, we have made hypotheses about the
glottal configurations of our subjects, splitting them into two groups. The question arises
as to how valid this classification is. In an attempt to answer this question, we have performed physiological measures on a subset of the subjects. These measures include glottal
waveform parameters obtained by inverse filtering of vocal tract airflow, and observation
of the vocal folds during phonation, via fiberscopy. This experiment and its results are
reported in Chapter 4. Second, the hypothesized difference in vocal fold configuration
would predict that members of Group 2 have a breathier voice quality than do members
of Group 1. We have performed a listening test to investigate this possibility. This test is
described in Chapter 5.
Finally, the wide ranges of parameter values that we have observed suggest that consideration of glottal characteristics has great importance for describing female speech and,
in addition t o formant frequencies and fundamental frequency, should be taken into account for applications such as synthesis and recognition of speech and speakers. We have
performed a synthesis experiment using our measures of glottal characteristics t o guide
the synthesis of the vowels /A, E / of six of our speakers. The success of this synthesis was

CHAPTER 3. ACOUSTIC MEASURES OF GLOTTAL CHARACTERISTICS

judged by a number of subjects in a listening test. This experiment and the results are
also presented in Chapter 5.

Introduction

In Chapter 3 we made acoustic measurements on the speech waveforms and spectra of
a group of 22 female speakers, and from these measurements we made hypotheses about

their glottal configurations and waveforms. In this chapter we turn to more direct, physiological measures of glottal characteristics in order t o gain some insight into the acoustic
measurements and, perhaps, validate our hypotheses. One method is based on oral airflow
and intraoral pressure. These are measured during speech production via a Rothenberg
mask (Rothenberg, 1973), shown earlier in Fig. 2.5. The glottal waveform is obtained by
inverse filtering of the oral airflow measured during phonation; that is, the effects of the
formants are removed, and glottal parameters can be extracted from this waveform and its
derivative. Figure 4.1 shows a schematic of a glottal waveform and its derivative. Glottal
waveform parameters that are of special interest are illustrated. In the second method,
a fiberscope is inserted through the nasal cavity and positioned above the vocal folds so
that the folds can be observed during phonation. The fiberscope system is schematicized
in Fig. 2.6. As we discussed in Chapter 2, these two methods are well established and
have been used in many studies to measure characteristics of vocal-fold vibration (see, for
example, Karlsson, 1986, 1988; Holmberg et al., 1988, in press; Gauffin and Sundberg,
1989; Sodersten and Lindestad, 1990; Kiritani et al., 1990).
Our subjects for this additional analysis came from both groups of speakers, those assumed to have abrupt glottal closure and those assumed to have nonsimultaneous closure.
Based on these groupings, we had some expectations about the results. For one, we ex-

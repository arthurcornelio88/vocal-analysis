Three Music Theater vocal qualities (“chesty belt,” “twangy belt,” and “legit”) were investigated in
female singers at their overlap range, between F#4-D5 (370-600 Hz). Six experienced Music
Theater singers performed each quality on two different vowels ([e], [O]). Audio and electroglottographic (EGG) signals were recorded as well as the vocal tract impedance. In chesty belt and
twangy belt, singers systematically tuned the frequency of their first vocal tract resonance (R1) to
the second harmonic (2f0) up to C5. R1 remained lower in frequency for the legit quality. No tuning
of the second vocal tract resonance (R2) was observed in any of these qualities although R2
frequency was significantly higher in both belt qualities than in legit. Closed quotient, degree of
symmetry of the EGG waveform, sound pressure level (SPL) and the energy of the spectrum above
1 kHz were significantly greater in chesty belt than in legit but not significantly different between
chesty belt and twangy belt qualities. A fourth quality (“mix”) was explored in three singers. Different production strategies were observed for each singer, with values of spectral, glottal and vocal
tract descriptors found in between those measured for legit and chesty belt qualities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Female professional Music Theater singers are expected
to master the vocal qualities: belt, legit, and mix. These
terms are commonly used by expert teachers (Bourne and
Kenny, 2008; Bourne et al., 2010) and within the Music Theater profession, although they are not yet well defined from a
physiological and acoustic point of view. This study aims to
provide objective measurements to characterize and compare
the laryngeal behavior, the vocal tract adjustment and spectral features of these Music Theater qualities.
Most research on the acoustics of the singing voice has
focused on classical and operatic singing. However, there have
been some recent studies of nonclassical styles (country, pop,
Broadway, Music Theater, R&B, jazz, rock, and blues),
increasingly referred to as contemporary commercial music
(CCM) vocal styles (Lovetri, 2008). CCM singing styles can be
distinguished from classical singing by the regular use of
amplification, a greater emphasis on lyrics and textual comprehension by the audience, and frequent employment of the voice
quality described as “belt” (Lovetri, 2002; AATS, 2008).
Perceptually, belt has been described as a projected
sound with “brightness,” “ring,” and “forward,” speech-like
vowels (Stanley, 1929; Osborne, 1979; Estill, 1980; Edwin,
2004; AATS, 2008; LeBorgne et al., 2010) in contrast to the
“covered” sound and “back” vowels of the classical voice.

However, the genre of CCM is broad, and the term belt
actually relates to a range of different sounds (Lovetri, 2002;
Popeil, 2007). In fact, there is considerable disagreement
among CCM experts about the distinctive features of belt,
some arguing that belt is not always loud (Edwin, 2002;
Popeil, 2007; LeBorgne et al., 2010), that belt has no vibrato
(Estill, 1980; Miles and Hollien, 1990), or that the degree of
vibrato may be a stylistic choice (Bourne and Kenny, 2008;
LeBorgne et al., 2010), that belt is intrinsically a nasal quality (Miles and Hollien, 1990) or not (Bourne and Kenny,
2008; LeBorgne et al., 2010).
Acoustically, the belt quality has shown increased
energy in the high frequencies of the spectrum (Bestebreurtje
and Schutte, 2000; McCoy, 2007) and higher first formant
frequencies (F1) compared to classical singing (Sundberg
et al., 1993). Proximity between F1 and the second voice
harmonic (2f0) has been reported on [a] and [O] vowels in a
female Music Theater singer (Schutte and Miller, 1993),
suggesting that belters may tune the first vocal tract resonance (R1)1 to the second voice harmonic (2f0). Such tuning
has been observed over the same range in Bulgarian singing
(Henrich et al., 2007), a musical style that shares some similarities in timbre with the female belt sound.
Physiologically, the belt quality has been characterized
by higher values of the laryngeal closed quotient and higher
levels of subglottal pressure than for classical singing (Estill,
1980; Sundberg et al., 1993; Bjorkner et al., 2006; Barlow
and Lovetri, 2010), supporting the argument by some singing
teachers that female belt is produced by raising the transition
pitch from ‘chest register” to “head register” by up to an
octave (Schutte and Miller, 1993; Bestebreurtje and Schutte,

quality of the other laryngeal mechanism. Sundberg et al.
(1993) found in a single female subject that mix demonstrated
features of both classical and belt singing: voice energy was
enhanced in high frequencies and first and second formants
were measured at higher frequencies, similar to belt production.
On the other hand, subglottal pressure and SPL were measured
at moderate values closer to operatic singing.
This review of current knowledge on the female Music
Theater voice raises the following questions about the characteristics of these vocal qualities:
(1) How do belt and legit qualities differ in terms of laryngeal behavior? Are there significant variations of glottal
behavior over the frequency range of each quality?
(2) Are there any differences in vocal tract resonance tuning
and source-filter interaction between belt and legit?
(3) Are there fundamentally different kinds of belt? In particular, is belt intrinsically twangy or does twangy belt
differ significantly from chesty belt?
(4) What are the glottal behaviors and vocal tract adjustments underlying mix quality?
To answer these questions, six experienced Music Theater singers were recorded. Audio and electroglottographic
signals were recorded on sustained pitches, together with the
frequencies of the first two vocal tract resonances, for two
types of belt (chesty and twangy), legit, and mix qualities,
on two vowels: [e] and [O].
II. MATERIAL AND METHOD
A. Subjects

The subjects for this study were six female Australian
Music Theater singers; four of them professional (Subjects
S1, S2, S3, S4) and two of them advanced tertiary level students specializing in Music Theater singing (subjects S5 and
S6). Their details are summarized in Table I.
B. Task

Singers were asked to sustain a single note for 4 s with
no change in pitch, loudness or vowel articulation and with
limited vibrato.
This study aims to compare different qualities at similar
levels of comfort versus effort across singers. Four increasing pitches were explored over the overlap range of belt or
legit qualities. This overlap range varied between singers
depending on their vocal classification and their belt range.
It was determined from the highest reported belt note of each
singer being C5 for four singers, D5 for singer S1, and B4
for singer S6 (see Table I).
Five measurements were made of each pitch, for two
mid vowels pronounced as monophthongs in Australian English: [O] (as in poor) and [e] (as in head). This procedure was
repeated for each quality: chesty belt, twangy belt, and legit,
beginning with the quality that was most comfortable for the
singer. No technical instructions were given to singers on
how to produce these qualities. An additional quality, mix,
was investigated in singers S1, S5, and S6. These three

2000; Miller, 2000). This hypothesis could be translated
physiologically as the extension of the laryngeal mechanism
M12 over the overlap range of M1 and M2, where classical
sopranos choose to sing in M2 instead of M1.
Singing experts have suggested that belt articulation
requires a higher and more forward tongue than for classical
singing (Miles and Hollien, 1990; Burdick, 2005; Bourne
and Kenny, 2008). The belt vocal tract shape has been compared to a megaphone (Titze and Worley, 2009) because of
the more constricted pharynx, higher larynx position, and
more opened mouth observed in this vocal production (Lawrence, 1979; Estill, 1980, 1988; Yanagisawa et al., 1983;
Sundberg et al., 1993; Lovetri et al., 1999; Edwin, 2004;
Balog, 2005). The configuration of a narrow vocal tract and
wide mouth opening is consistent with the higher F1 values
reported in belt compared to classical singing (Sundberg
et al., 1993). However, one study suggests that some singers
can also produce belt with a relatively low larynx and wide
pharynx (Lovetri et al., 1999).
Perceptually, there appear to be different kinds of belt,
described by singing teachers and experts of CCM styles as
“traditional belt,” “heavy/weighted/chesty belt,” “speechlike belt,” or “twangy belt” (Popeil, 2007; Bourne and
Kenny, 2008). However, scientific studies of the acoustic
and physiological features of belt have not made that distinction between belt qualities, neither has any study compared
and characterized objective differences. In particular, it
remains an open question whether belt is an intrinsically
twangy quality or whether twangy belt is actually a subcategory of belt. While twang has not been specifically studied
in Music Theater singing, it has been explored in country
singers (Cleveland et al., 2001), stage actors (Nawka et al.,
1997), in a single female non classical singer (Sundberg and
Thalen, 2010), and in relationship to voice efficiency (Titze,
2001; Titze et al., 2003). Twang has been associated with
higher values of the closed quotient (Titze et al., 2003; Sundberg and Thalen, 2010) higher subglottal pressures (Sundberg and Thalen, 2010), constriction of the aryepiglottic area
(Yanagisawa et al., 1983; Story et al., 2001; Titze, 2001;
Titze et al., 2003), widening of lips (Story et al., 2001),
higher frequencies of F1 and F2 (Story et al., 2001; Sundberg and Thalen, 2010), nasalization of some vowels (Story
et al., 2001), and spectral enhancement around 3 kHz (Yanagisawa et al., 1983; Nawka et al., 1997).
Very few studies have been conducted on Music Theater
voice qualities other than belt. In particular, no objective
measurements have been made of the legit quality. We only
know from the descriptions of expert teachers that legit is
grounded in the classical tradition, sung largely in “head”
register for female singers with “back” vowels and reported
over a greater pitch range than belt (Edwin, 2003; Balog,
2005; AATS, 2008; Bourne and Kenny, 2008).
Likewise, no studies have characterized the laryngeal
behavior of the CCM mix voice. Several studies of the classical
“voix mixte” (Castellengo et al., 2004; Lamesch et al., 2007)
have suggested that it can be produced either in M1 or in M2
laryngeal mechanism but never in an intermediary mechanism.
Instead singers slightly modify their vocal effort and vocal tract
adjustment so that the resulting sound is similar to the usual

singers understood this term and were able to demonstrate a
noticeably different sound from the other three qualities.
Audio samples of musical phrases are provided as supplementary material online to illustrate the four qualities investigated in this study.3 These examples were produced by the
singer S1 with the highest or sustained pitch at C5. These files
are given as perceptual examples, as they were recorded after
the experiment with different material and conditions.
All singers were given 10 min to warm up and were
instructed to take regular breaks during the 1 h recording session. Subjects were also provided with water throughout the
session to keep their voices hydrated.

During the final remaining 3 s of phonation, the first two
vocal tract resonances were measured using a technique
described by Epps et al. (1997) and Joliveau et al. (2004).
During phonation, the vocal tract was excited at the lips via
the flexible tube (internal diameter of 6 mm), using a synthesized broadband signal consisting of a sum of sine waves over
the range of 200–3000 Hz spaced at 11 Hz ( ¼ 44.1 kHz/212).
The nearby microphone recorded the vocal tract response to
the excitation. Frequencies of the vocal tract resonances were
detected manually from the maxima of the measured pressure
ratios

where pk is the pressure spectrum measured with an open
mouth, and pr is the radiated spectrum measured at the lips
with the mouth closed (performed during an earlier calibration procedure).
The electroglottographic signal was simultaneously
recorded with a two-channel electroglottograph (Glottal
Enterprises EG2) using medical gel to improve electric contact between the skin and the electrodes. Electrodes were
placed on both sides of the thyroid cartilage while the singer
was singing in her comfortable middle range. The best placement of the electrodes was found by monitoring the EGG
waveform with an oscilloscope. Medical tape was used on
each electrode, instead of the usual Velcro neck strap, to prevent the electrodes from moving down throughout the
experiment. No automatic gain control was used.
Using MATLAB software, four parameters were extracted
from the 4 s of EGG signal, using an 80 ms sliding window
with no overlap:
(1) The mean fundamental frequency (f0), with a standard
autocorrelation method.
(2) The mean amplitude of the EGG signal, the average of
which is highly affected by inter-individual differences
in neck constitution (width, amount of fat, and muscles)
and tissues conductivity. As a result, only intra-speaker
variations of that parameter are meaningful and can be
interpreted (mostly as variations in the amount of glottal
contact, but also partly as vertical displacements of the
larynx). To conduct statistical analysis, we normalized
the amplitude of the EGG signal by its mean value as
observed in the legit quality for each singer.

One 1/4-in. pressure microphone (Brüel and Kjær
4944-A) was attached to the front of a stand, alongside a
small, flexible tube that was connected to a loudspeaker via
an impedance matching horn. This acoustic source was
used to excite the vocal tract with a synthesized broadband
signal while the microphone recorded the response of the
vocal tract to that excitation. The stand was adjusted for
height so that the microphone and the tube rested gently
upon the singer’s lower lip during phonation. Signals from
both microphones were amplified (Brüel and Kjær Nexus
2690), and digitized at 16 bits and a rate of 44.1 kHz using
a Firewire audio interface (MOTU 828).
Spectral parameters and SPL were measured from the
first clean second of phonation (no broadband excitation
noise), and vocal tract resonances were measured during the
second to fourth seconds of phonation. The electroglottographic signal was measured from the full 4 s of phonation.
The mean SPL and the average spectrum (with NFFT
¼ 4096 points) were measured from the first second of
phonation. The SPL was measured accurately, using the internal calibration signal of 1 V-RMS at 1 kHz delivered by
the conditioning amplifier (Brüel and Kjær Nexus 2690), and
knowing its V/Pa transduction coefficient. The a coefficient,
defined as the ratio (in dB) of energy above and below 1 kHz
(Frøkjaer-Jensen and Prytz, 1976; Sundberg and Nordenberg, 2006) was calculated from the long term average spectrum (LTAS) using MATLAB. So was the power ratio, defined
as the energy difference in dB between the greatest harmonic
level in the 0-2 kHz range and the greatest harmonic level in
the 2-4 kHz range (Omori et al., 1996),

Because of a very bad skin conductivity, the EGG signal
of S4 was too poor in quality to make accurate recordings of
her glottal behavior. Consequently, glottal observations are
reported for only five singers.
A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
repeated measurements was conducted using SPSSV (Factor
1: quality, three levels: legit, chesty belt, twangy belt.4 Factor 2: vowel, two levels: [e], [O]). The main effect of the factor quality was tested first. Specific contrasts between chesty
belt and legit qualities, and between chesty belt and twangy
belt qualities, were also examined—applying Bonferroni
adjustments—to determine whether voice parameters were
significantly different between these qualities. Second, the
statistical interaction between quality and vowel factors was
tested to determine whether the difference in voice parameters among legit, chesty belt, and twangy belt qualities
R

depended on the vowel. The results of these statistical analyses are reported at the bottom of Figs. 2 and 3. The conventional notation was adopted for indicating statistical
significance: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***, P < 0.001, and ns
(not significant) P > 0.05.
III. RESULTS
A. Comparison of legit and chesty belt qualities
1. Vocal tract resonances

R1 frequencies of legit productions varied relatively little over the investigated pitch range nor did they increase
with pitch. They were never tuned to one voice harmonic
(see Fig. 1).
In chesty belt, all the singers except S3 increased the frequency of R1 with pitch and closely adjusted it to the second
voice harmonic (2f0) up to C5 in both [O] and [e] vowels (see
Fig. 1). On average, R1 frequencies were 187 6 48 Hz5 higher
in chesty belt than in legit over the pitch range considered (F#4D5). However, such a significant difference in R1 was observed
at all pitches for only two singers (S3 and S4). The other singers
showed a significant difference in R1 from G#4 only.
Legit and chesty belt qualities did not differ by the presence or the absence of R2 tuning: in both qualities, R2

function of f0. Each vertical bar indicates for each pitch the mean value and the standard deviation of the two first resonances frequencies (R1 and R2) measured over the 6 singers (for legit and belt qualities) and over 3 singers (for mix). As singers did not all produce the same pitches (see Table I), mean values and
standard deviations were calculated over a varying number of productions (from minimum 3 to maximum 18 productions). The dotted diagonal lines indicate
the relationship R ¼ n f0. They visually emphasise how R1 is tuned to 2f0 in chesty belt and twangy belt.

(3) The mean glottal open quotient (OQ), computed from
the closing (positive) and opening (negative) peaks
detected in the derivative of the EGG signal [DEGG, see
(Henrich et al., 2004)].
(4) The mean contact speed quotient (Qcs), defined as the
ratio in amplitude of closing and opening peaks of the
DEGG signal and describing the degree of asymmetry of
the EGG waveform.

2. Glottal behavior

Glottal observations are reported for five singers only,
as the EGG signal of S4 was too poor in quality.
In these five singers, OQ values were significantly lower
in chesty belt than in legit (by 0.21 6 0.04), without any
difference between the vowels [e] and [O] (see Fig. 2).
The Qcs tended to be higher (i.e., the EGG waveform
tended to be more asymmetrical) in chesty belt than legit (by
0.75 6 0.67), but this effect was not found to be statistically
significant (see Fig. 2).
No significant difference was observed in the amplitude
of the EGG signal between legit and chesty belt productions,
irrespective of the vowel (see Fig. 2).
3. Voice spectrum

For the six singers in this study, SPL was significantly
higher in chesty belt than in legit (by 10.7 dB 6 4.3 dB) as
were values of the a coefficient (by 4.4 6 1.0 dB). These differences between legit and chesty belt qualities were similar
for both vowels (see Fig. 3).
Values of power ratio also tended to be lower (i.e.
energy in the 24 kHz region tended to be more enhanced)

in chesty belt than in legit (by 6.4 6 6.4 dB), but this difference was not found to be statistically significant (see
Fig. 3).
B. Comparison of chesty belt and twangy belt
qualities

As in chesty belt, R1 frequency in twangy belt was
tuned to the second harmonic up to C5. This was observed in
all singers for the vowel [e] and in four singers only (S1, S2,
S5, and S6) for the vowel [O]. No significant difference was
observed in the average R1 frequency of chesty belt and
twangy belt productions (see Fig. 1).
Again as in chesty belt, no tuning of R2 frequency with
ascending pitch was observed in twangy belt (see Fig. 1).
Nevertheless, twangy belt differed from chesty belt by
66 6 37 Hz higher R2 frequencies on average.
No significant difference was observed between chesty
belt and twangy belt qualities in the values of glottal parameters nor in the values of SPL and spectrum descriptors (see
Figs. 2 and 3).
C. Mix quality in three singers

We recorded mix quality for three of the six singers: S1,
S5, and S6.
1. Vocal tract resonances

The vocal tract behavior of singer S5 in mix was similar
to chesty belt: She tuned R1 frequencies to the second voice
harmonic (2f0) but only up to A4. Her R2 frequencies were

the bottom of each graph statistical results summarize whether the factor quality has a significant effect on glottal parameters, how the three qualities contrast
from each other, and whether the influence of quality depends on the vowel.

frequencies were not found to be consistently tuned to one
voice harmonic over the pitch range investigated (see
Fig. 1). Only one singer (S4) was observed to tune the frequency of R2 to the third voice harmonic (3f0) on [O] vowels
and in chesty belt. On the other hand, both qualities differed
by their mean R2 frequency that was on average
205 6 106 Hz higher in chesty belt than in legit (see Fig. 1).

two vowels [e] (dark) and [O] (light). Each bar represents the mean value and the standard deviation of each acoustic parameter over the six singers. At the bottom of each graph, statistical results summarize whether the factor quality has a significant effect on acoustic features, how the three qualities contrast from
each other, and whether the influence of quality depends on the vowel.

3. Voice spectrum

Comparable patterns of voice production were again
noted for S5 and S6 in mix with SPL values measured right
in between those of chesty belt and legit qualities. For S1,
SPL values were measured in a range closer to legit, consistent with her glottal behavior.
Values of the a coefficient were measured in between
those of chesty belt and legit, except for singer S6’s vowels
[o], which were closer to the values of chesty belt.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

2. Glottal behavior

A. Acoustic and physiological differences between
belt and legit qualities

At the laryngeal level, two production strategies were
also observed across the three singers.
For S1, her glottal behavior in mix was comparable to
that of legit: OQ values were slightly lower in mix than in
legit (by 0.07) but much higher than average values in chesty
belt (see Fig. 4). Values of Qcs were much lower than values
observed in chesty belt in a similar range to values observed
in legit (see Fig. 4).
The glottal behavior of singers S5 and S6 in mix was
more complex. For these two singers, OQ values in mix
showed a discontinuous variation over pitch. Below A4A#4, OQ values were observed in a low range close to that
of chesty belt (0.5). Above A4-A#4, they were observed in
a significantly higher range, close or similar to that of legit
(0.63) (see Fig. 4).

In this study, belt productions are characterized by
higher R1 frequencies. This is consistent with higher F1 values reported in previous studies (Sundberg et al., 1993) as
well as with the raised larynx, more constricted pharynx and
more open mouth described by previous studies (Lawrence,
1979; Estill, 1980; Yanagisawa et al., 1983; Estill, 1988;
Miles and Hollien, 1990; Sundberg et al., 1993; Lovetri
et al., 1999; Edwin, 2004; Balog, 2005; Titze and Worley,
2009).
In addition, our results show that R2 frequencies are significantly higher in belt than legit. Again, this is consistent
with the more forward position of the tongue taught by belting teachers (Miles and Hollien, 1990; Burdick, 2005;
Bourne and Kenny, 2008) and with the more backward articulation of classical singing that is considered to influence the

in a similar range for both mix and chesty belt and were significantly higher than legit (see Fig. 4).
Conversely, the vocal tract behavior of singers S1 and
S6 in mix was either closer to legit or intermediary to legit
and chesty belt production. These singers did not demonstrate any tuning of R1 and R2 to voice harmonics in mix or
in legit (see Fig. 4). Their R1 mix frequencies lay between
chesty belt and legit (for S6) or closer to legit (for S1), while
their R2 frequencies were close to those observed in legit for
[O]. There were no significant differences in R2 frequencies
between legit, mix and chesty belt qualities on [e] vowels
(see Fig. 4).

Music Theater legit quality (Edwin, 2003; Balog, 2005;
AATS, 2008; Bourne and Kenny, 2008).
Our results did not show any tuning of R1 in legit, even
over B4–D5 where classical sopranos usually start tuning R1
to the first harmonic (f0) (Joliveau et al., 2004; Garnier et al.,
2010). On the other hand, our results showed systematic
adjustment of the R1 frequency to the second harmonic (2f0)
in belt, up to C5, for both [e] and [O]. This is consistent with
the proximity between F1 and 2f0 reported in a previous
study (Schutte and Miller, 1993). No significant tuning of R2
was observed in legit or in belt, enabling singers to maintain
phonetic distinction between vowel categories although the
systematic R1:2f0 tuning may cause a loss of the distinction
in vowel height.

B. Subcategories of belt

No significant difference was observed between twangy
belt and chesty belt qualities except that R2 frequencies were
significantly higher in twangy belt than chesty belt for all
singers. A consistent tendency was also observed across
singers toward slightly lower SPL, higher OQ values, and
more symmetrical EGG waveform in twangy belt, although
this was not statistically significant. In previous studies,
twang was related to higher F1 and F2 frequencies (Story
et al., 2001; Sundberg and Thalen, 2010), lower OQ values

variation of R1 frequencies with ascending pitch, the dashed diagonal lines
indicate the relationship R1 ¼ 2f0. For the sake of simplicity, parameters values are averaged over the pitch range(s) where they were similar. Several
values are displayed only where the parameter varied significantly between
two pitch ranges (e.g., OQ values below and above A4-A#4 for S5 and S6)
or between the two vowels considered (e.g., the a coefficient, R2 and the
SPL for S1).

The R1:2f0 resonance tuning in belt certainly helped
production of the high sound pressure levels measured in all
singers for this quality: around 120 dB at lips, 11 dB louder
than in legit where no resonance tuning was observed.
This difference in voice intensity between belt and legit
may explain the differences observed in glottal contact and
in the voice spectrum. Indeed, the lower values of OQ measured in belt are consistent with greater vocal effort, as well
as greater values of Qcs (i.e., more asymmetrical EGG waveform) and weaker values of the a coefficient (i.e., enhanced
energy above 1 kHz) (Huang et al., 1995; Henrich, 2001;
Henrich et al., 2005).
However, these differences may also be interpreted in
terms of laryngeal mechanisms. Indeed, OQ values in belt
were observed in a completely distinct range (0.43 6 0.06)
to values in legit (0.68 6 0.08), supporting the idea that they
correspond to two fundamentally different laryngeal behaviors. Furthermore, these two ranges correspond to typical
OQ values in laryngeal mechanisms M1 and M2 (Henrich
et al., 2005). This interpretation in terms of laryngeal mechanisms would be consistent with weaker values of Qcs measured in legit. Indeed, the EGG waveform has been reported
to be more symmetrical in M2 than M1 (Henrich, 2006;
Roubeau et al., 2009). On the other hand, Roubeau et al.
(2009) described the amplitude of the EGG signal decreasing
significantly (by about 40%) during the transition from M1
to M2 in female singers. In our data, belt and legit qualities
did not differ in amplitude of glottal contact.
It is not clear whether the two distinct laryngeal behaviors
that we recorded correspond to the laryngeal mechanisms M1
and M2 or whether the observed differences in glottal behavior relate to varying degrees of source-filter interaction and
vocal effort. In any case, there is a strong relationship between
the presence of R1:2f0 tuning and the measured glottal parameters: Indeed, S3 in chesty belt demonstrated R1:2f0 tuning up
to A4 and a discontinuous change in OQ values at that pitch.
The other singers present low OQ values up to their maximum
belted note, around C5 (1000 Hz), which corresponds to the
maximum range of R1 frequencies in speech. This is also the
pitch at which S1 cannot maintain R1:2f0 tuning any further.
This raises the question of whether the end of the R1:2f0 tuning conditions the upper limit of the belt range, and whether
the rare singers who can belt up to F5 have developed an
articulatory strategy that enables them to continue increasing
R1 higher than 1 kHz, just like some coloratura sopranos can
extend the tuning of R1:f0 tuning above C6, up to F#6
(Garnier et al., 2010).

C. First conclusions about mix

For all three singers, glottal and vocal tract measurements
in mix quality were indeed observed at values in between those
measured for legit and chesty belt qualities. However, each
singer adopted different strategies to achieve this outcome.
For S1, the mix quality appears to be a more “pressed”
variation of legit. OQ values in mix were slightly lower than
for legit but remained in a similar high range, so mix and legit
qualities appear to be underlined by the same glottal behavior.
This singer did not demonstrate any R1:2f0 tuning in mix; nor
was this tuning evident in legit. R2 frequencies, sound pressure level, and voice energy above 1 kHz were intermediary
between legit and belt values but closer to legit.
For S5 and S6, the glottal behavior in mix was adapted
with pitch, comparable to belt in the lower range and comparable to legit in the upper range. Indeed, OQ values of mix
productions below A4 were similar to those of belt at this
range. From B4, OQ values rise significantly, becoming
closer to legit in value. This suggests that S5 and S6 changed
their glottal behavior from A4 to B4.
Despite these similarities in glottal behavior, S5 and S6 differed in their resonance strategies to produce the mix quality.
S5 demonstrated a tuning of R1 to the second voice harmonic (2f0) as she did in belt but only up to A4. This also corresponds to the pitch at which this singer changes glottal
behavior. Furthermore, R2 frequencies were intermediary
between legit and belt values but closer to belt. For S6, on the
other hand, vocal tract adjustments in mix are closer to legit:
No resonance tuning is observed and R2 frequencies were
intermediary between legit and belt values but closer to legit.
Distinct differences in the vocal production of belt and
legit were demonstrated by the six singers in this study, suggesting that technical and pedagogical approaches may need
to differ for these styles. There were no significant differenJ. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 131, No. 2, February 2012

ces between twangy belt and chesty belt except in the higher
values of R2 frequencies for twangy belt.
The three singers who were able to demonstrate mix
quality used different glottal and vocal tract strategies to produce a sound that was “in between” belt and legit. Because
we have only measured a small sample of singers, these
results can only be regarded as indicative. Further study on
the CCM mix voice may give more information on typical
glottal and vocal tract configurations for this style.

Laryngeal mechanisms M1 and M2 are most commonly used in speech
and singing and underlie “chest/modal” and “head/falsetto” laryngeal
registers respectively (Roubeau et al., 1997). In mechanism M1, the thyroarytenoid muscle is part of the vibrating mass of the vocal folds. Vocal
folds are thick. Variations of f0 are mainly determined by the stiffness of
the folds, controlled by the contraction of the thyroarytenoid muscle. By
contrast, the vocal folds are thinner in laryngeal mechanism M2 due to the
assumed decoupling of the thyro-arytenoid muscle from the vibrating
mass (Van den Berg, 1960; Hirano, 1982, Roubeau, 1993; Lacau St Guily
and Roubeau, 1994). Variations of f0 are mainly determined by the stretching of the folds, controlled by the contraction of the crico-thyroid muscle.
There is an overlap pitch range in which singers can choose to produce
the sound in either M1 or M2, depending on the desired vocal quality
(Roubeau et al., 2009).

(Titze et al., 2003; Sundberg and Thalen, 2010), and
enhanced energy around 3 kHz (Yanagisawa et al., 1983;
Nawka et al., 1997). In this study, the frequency of R1, the
open quotient and the power ratio did not distinguish twangy
belt productions from chesty belt ones.
These different results suggest that chesty belt and twangy
belt are not fundamentally different modes of production.
Although chesty belt might correspond to a slightly louder and
more “pressed” phonation than twangy belt, both qualities
appear to be underlined by the same glottal behavior. Furthermore, both kinds of belt are comparable in terms of sourcefilter interaction as they both show a similar tuning of R1 to the
second harmonic. Both qualities only differ significantly in
vocal tract adjustment: The higher R2 frequencies measured in
twangy belt are likely to correspond to a more forward position
of the tongue. Further research involving articulatory measurements would be needed to test this hypothesis.
To conclude, singers may be able to slightly vary their
voice quality when belting, by adding more or less twang, by
varying vocal intensity, or by adopting a more or less
“forward” articulation, but the small differences in vocal
production between twangy and chesty belt qualities do not
support the existence of subcategories of belt.

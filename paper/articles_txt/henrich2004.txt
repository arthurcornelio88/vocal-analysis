This article presents the results of glottal open-quotient measurements in the case of singing voice
production. It explores the relationship between open quotient and laryngeal mechanisms, vocal
intensity, and fundamental frequency. The audio and electroglottographic signals of 18 classically
trained male and female singers were recorded and analyzed with regard to vocal intensity,
fundamental frequency, and open quotient. Fundamental frequency and open quotient are derived
from the differentiated electroglottographic signal, using the DECOM 共DEgg Correlation-based
Open quotient Measurement兲 method. As male and female phonation may differ in respect to
vocal-fold vibratory properties, a distinction is made between two different glottal configurations,
which are called laryngeal mechanisms: mechanism 1 共related to chest, modal, and male head
register兲 and mechanism 2 共related to falsetto for male and head register for female兲. The results
show that open quotient depends on the laryngeal mechanisms. It ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 in
mechanism 1 and from 0.5 to 0.95 in mechanism 2. The open quotient is strongly related to vocal
intensity in mechanism 1 and to fundamental frequency in mechanism 2. © 2005 Acoustical

I. INTRODUCTION

Voice quality is mainly due to the characteristics of
vocal-fold vibratory movement. Thus, a better understanding
of these properties would help to characterize voice quality.
In this context, the open quotient O q is a glottal source parameter of considerable interest, as it has been reported to be
related to voice qualities such as ‘‘breathy’’ and ‘‘pressed’’
共e.g., Alku and Vilkman, 1996; Klatt and Klatt, 1990兲. It is
defined as the ratio of the glottal open time over the fundamental period. It is a dimensionless parameter, ranging from
0 共no opening兲 to 1 共no or incomplete closure兲. This glottal
source parameter is the counterpart of the closed quotient
C q , given that O q ⫽1⫺C q . It can be measured directly by
the use of high-speed visualization 共Childers et al., 1990;
Timcke et al., 1958兲, photoglottographic signals 共Dejonckere, 1981; Hanson et al., 1990; Kitzing, 1982, 1983; Kitzing

et al., 1990; Lecluse, 1977; Lecluse and Brocaar, 1977;

also been used, based on inverse filtering of volume velocity
or acoustic signals 共Holmberg et al., 1988, 1989, 1995; Sundberg et al., 1999a兲. It has also been related to the amplitude

共Hanson, 1995, 1997; Sundberg et al., 1999a兲.
Most of these studies showed a variation of open quotient with vocal intensity in speech and singing. A decrease
of open quotient with increase of vocal intensity was found
with high-speed visualization of one male speaker 共Timcke
et al., 1958兲, photoglottographic analysis of 20 female
speakers 共Kitzing and Sonesson, 1974兲, electroglottographic
analysis of ten male speakers 共Orlikoff, 1991兲, and glottal
flow analysis of 25 male and 20 female speakers 共Holmberg
et al., 1988兲, and six country singers 共Sundberg et al.,
1999b兲. Only a slight trend was found by Hanson et al.
共1990兲 on photoglottographic analysis of 12 male speakers.
No relation was found by Lecluse and Brocaar 共1977兲 on
electroglottographic analysis of six untrained male singers,
which could be explained by the use of a slightly different
open-quotient definition, distinguishing opening time and
open time.
The variation of open quotient with fundamental frequency has also been explored. In the case of male speakers,
previous research has not shown any relationship between
open quotient and fundamental frequency whatever the measurement method 共Childers et al., 1990; Hanson et al., 1990;
Lecluse and Brocaar, 1977; Timcke et al., 1958兲. In the case
of female speakers, an increase of open quotient with an
increase of fundamental frequency was found by Kitzing and
Sonesson 共1974兲. Holmberg et al. 共1989兲 observed that open

quotient tended to increase with fundamental frequency for
both male and female speakers, although the correlation was
not strong. Studying trained and untrained male and female
singers, Howard 共1995兲 reported a variation in open quotient
with fundamental frequency in the case of female singers,
depending on the singer’s experience, but no relation between these parameters was found in the case of male singers
共Howard et al., 1990兲. No relation between open quotient
and fundamental frequency was found in the case of six premier male country singers 共Sundberg et al., 1999b兲.
The differences found between male and female subjects
may be due to the use of different laryngeal mechanisms,
which differ with respect to the length and thickness of the
vocal folds, as well as to the muscular laryngeal tensions
involved in the process of voice production 共Hirano, 1982;
Roubeau, 1993兲. Indeed, voice production can be divided
into four main laryngeal mechanisms, the evidence for such
division being provided by the noticeable transitions in the
electroglottographic signals during the production of a glissando 共Henrich et al., 2003; Roubeau, 1993; Roubeau et al.,
1991兲. The laryngeal mechanisms can be related to the wellknown voice registers: vocal fry is produced in mechanism 0,
the so-called chest or modal register and male head register
are produced in mechanism 1, the falsetto register 共male兲 or
head register 共female兲 are produced in mechanism 2 and the
flageolet, or whistle, register is produced in mechanism 3.
Mechanisms 1 and 2 are commonly used in speech and singing. In mechanism 1, the vocal folds are thick, leading to
vertical phase differences in vibration, and longer closing
and opening phases as compared to mechanism 2, where the
vocal folds are thin and vibrate without any vertical phase
difference 共Hollien, 1974兲. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect lower open-quotient values in mechanism 1 than in
mechanism 2. All the studies found in the literature seem to
confirm this assumption 共Kitzing, 1982; Lecluse, 1977;
Lecluse and Brocaar, 1977兲. A study of the frequency jump
at the transition between mechanisms in singing brought to
light sudden changes in closed quotient that accompany or
precede the transition 共Miller et al., 2002兲. In a study of male
singers, Sundberg and Högset 共1999兲 showed that the openquotient differences between mechanisms were larger for
baritones, as compared with tenors and counter tenors, who
may even have equal open quotient in both mechanisms.
The open quotient seems to be strongly dependent on the
laryngeal mechanism used by the speaker or the singer during vocal production. A study of the open quotient’s relationship to parameters such as vocal intensity or fundamental
frequency therefore needs to take laryngeal mechanism into
account. Unfortunately, few studies have done so. This could
partly explain the lack of convergence between studies on
this issue.
To date, no study has been specifically devoted to a detailed exploration of the variations of open quotient in western operatic singing. Our purpose is to provide an overview
of the variations of open quotient with vocal intensity and
fundamental frequency for all the main tessituras in classical
singing voice production, taking into account the laryngeal
mechanisms involved. We hope that our results will help to
make sense of the seemingly conflicting results of other stud1418

ies. The voice database recorded for the purpose of this study
and the analysis method are presented in Sec. II. In order to
avoid the problems and limitations inherent in inverse filtering 共Henrich, 2001; Henrich et al., 2001兲, electroglottography was chosen as a noninvasive technique to measure the
glottal vibratory movement, and the differentiated EGG signal 共DEGG兲 was used for open-quotient measurements. In
Sec. III, the results of the database analysis will be presented,
pointing out the relations of open quotient with laryngeal
mechanisms, vocal intensity, and fundamental frequency.
These relations will be discussed in Sec. IV, and the main
results will be summarized in Sec. V.
II. MATERIAL AND METHOD
A. Recording procedure

Recording sessions took place in a soundproof booth.
The acoustic signal was recorded using a 1/2 in. condenser
microphone 共Brüel & Kjær 4165兲 placed 50 cm from the
singer’s mouth, a preamplifier 共Brüel & Kjær 2669兲, and a
conditioning amplifier 共Brüel & Kjær NEXUS 2690兲. The
electroglottographic signal was recorded by the use of a twochannel electroglottograph 共EG2, Rothenberg, 1992兲. Both
signals were recorded simultaneously on the two channels of
a DAT recorder 共PORTADAT PDR1000兲. A calibration for
absolute sound-pressure level 共SPL兲 measurement was carried out in each recording session by using the NEXUS amplifier to generate a reference tone, which was sent through
the acquisition chain and recorded on the DAT recorder. In
addition, an analog sound-level meter was placed close to the
microphone, while the singers were asked to produce a sustained sound at a relatively steady loudness of their choice.
The SPL recorded by the sound-level meter was noted and
used later for assessing the validity of the reference-tone
calibration procedure.
The singers were asked to stand still during the whole
recording session, and their position was marked on the floor.
As they were not physically constrained in terms of bodily
movements, head movements could occur during the recording, which should have a second-order effect on the SPL
measurements at 50 cm.
B. Subjects

Eighteen trained singers were recorded for this study:
seven baritones 共subjects B1 to B7兲, two tenors 共T1,T2兲,
three counter tenors 共CT1 to CT3兲, three mezzo-sopranos
共MS1 to MS3兲, and three sopranos 共S1 to S3兲. Most of them
were professional singers, earning their living from singing.
Among other questions, the singers were asked to indicate in
what range of pitch they used mechanisms 1 and 2. The
answers are given in Fig. 1. Notice the presence of a frequency band where both mechanisms can be used. To produce these frequencies, the singer can thus choose to phonate
either in mechanism 1 or in mechanism 2.
C. Protocol

For each singer, the recording session lasted about 20
min. The singer was asked to go through a precise protocol
Henrich et al.: Glottal open quotient in singing

FIG. 1. Tessitura of the 18 singers recorded for this study, as given by the singer. For each singer, the pitch range is given in mechanism 1 共M1兲 and
mechanism 2 共M2兲. In the case of baritone B5, no range is given in mechanism 2, as this singer did not use it at all and so had no idea about his range. Their
age and the years of training are also given. Four of them are not professional singers 共B1, MS1, MS2, and MS3兲.

共see below兲, and, if necessary, to describe his/her vocal production in terms of voice registers, or voice quality. Indeed,
singers are apparently able to identify the laryngeal mechanism in which they phonate, information worth eliciting. We
chose to use a noninvasive method for measuring glottal activity and only gathered information on vocal intensity 共I兲,
fundamental frequency ( f 0 ), and open quotient (O q ). The
protocol for this experiment is thus devised to study openquotient variations as a function of fundamental frequency
and vocal intensity for singing exercises 共e.g., sustained
vowels and crescendos兲 and for musical sentences 共sung sentences兲. The subjects were asked to reduce the amount of
vibrato if possible. The tasks were as follows:
共1兲 Speech/singing/shouting: A sentence in French, chosen
by the subject, was first spoken, then sung, and finally
shouted.
共2兲 Sung sentence: The first bars of Gounod’s Ave Maria
were performed with various degrees of loudness 共piano,
mezzo-forte, forte兲.
共3兲 Sustained vowels and crescendos/decrescendos: Three
selected vowels 关a兴, 关e兴, and 关u兴 were performed at different pitches depending on the singer’s pitch range 共see
Table I兲 and at three degrees of loudness: piano, mezzoforte, and forte. The subject was asked to maintain vowel
color, pitch, and loudness during production. The sounds
were 4 to 8 s long, and in cases when the laryngeal
mechanism could not be straightforwardly identified, the
subject indicated which laryngeal mechanism he or she
was using. Following these tasks, the singers were asked
to perform crescendos and decrescendos on the selected
pitches and vowels.

共4兲 Glissandos: Rising and falling glissandos, mezzo-forte,
continuous, and 共if possible兲 without vibrato, were requested at the end of the session.
Each task was only performed once, apart from the glissandos which could be repeated several times. The use of
both mechanisms was not mandatory in this study, and so the
singers were not asked to repeat a task while singing in another laryngeal mechanism. However, some singers sometimes volunteered to do so. Singer CT1 repeated the
sustained-vowels task on pitch D4 共293 Hz兲, mezzo-forte, in
both mechanisms. Singers B2, B3, B4, B7, T2, CT1, CT2,
and CT3 repeated either the spoken, the shouted, or the sung
French sentence in both mechanisms. Singers T1, T2, CT1,
CT2, MS1, and S2 sang the Ave Maria air in both mechanisms.
Another part of the protocol was dedicated to the exploration of various voice qualities. In the first task, the choice
of voice quality was left to the singer. In the second task,
voice qualities were specified, such as natural versus lyrical
voice production. The exploration of these voice qualities
from a perceptual and acoustical point of view is underway
共Garnier et al., 2004兲.

D. Analysis method

The fundamental frequency and the open quotient are
measured from the DEGG signal, by using the DECOM
共DEgg Correlation-based Open quotient Measurement兲
method as described in a previous paper 共Henrich et al.,
2004兲. The method will be summarized here, and we refer
the reader to that paper for more detail.
An EGG signal gives information about the vocal-fold
contact area. A sudden variation in the contact will lead to
noticeable peaks in the derivative 共DEGG signal兲. These
peaks can accurately be related to the glottal opening and
closing instants, which are, respectively, defined as the instants at which the glottal flow starts to increase greatly from
or decrease greatly toward the baseline 共Childers et al., 1990,
1983兲. The fundamental period can thus be derived from a
DEGG signal by measuring the duration between two consecutive glottal closing instants. The duration between a glottal opening instant and the consecutive glottal closing instant
corresponds to the open time. The open quotient can be deHenrich et al.: Glottal open quotient in singing

rived from these two measures as the ratio between open
time and fundamental period.
The DECOM method is applied to a four-period windowed DEGG signal which is separated into two parts: its
positive part, which shows strong peaks related to glottal
closing instants, and its negative part, which shows weaker
peaks related to glottal opening instants. The fundamental
period duration is derived from the autocorrelation function
calculated on the positive part of the DEGG signal. The open
time is derived from the intercorrelation function calculated
between the positive part and the negative part.
These measures are accurate in the case where the glottal opening and/or closing peaks are single and precise. In
some cases, however, the DEGG signal can present double or
multiple peaks during the opening or the closing phase.
Therefore, the DECOM method automatically detects double
or undefined peaks, and only the measurements on glottal
cycles for which the opening and closing peaks are unique
are taken into account in this study.

in mean value being at most 10 dB with a mean difference of
4.2 dB. A great difference in the open-quotient mean values
is observed in every case between mechanism 1 共M1兲 and
mechanism 2 共M2兲. Whatever the vocal production is, the
mean values of open quotient are between 0.4 and 0.65 in
M1, and between 0.65 and 0.8 in M2. In the case of counter
tenor CT1, who sang and shouted the sentence in both
mechanisms, a difference between singing and shouting is
found in M1. It goes along with a 10-dB increase in vocal
intensity, which could be the effect of increased vocal effort
in shouting. The relation between open quotient and vocal
intensity will be developed in more detail in Sec. III B.
During the Ave Maria task, a few singers also managed
to sing in both mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 3. Vocal intensity does not vary much between both productions in most
cases, the differences in mean value between M1 and M2
being at most 8 dB with a mean difference of 3.8 dB. The
pitch is quite different, allowing the singers to sing comfortably in one and the same mechanism over the whole sentence. Only counter tenor CT2 managed to sing the sentence
in both mechanisms at the same pitch, with a mean vocal
intensity of 77 dB in both cases. The differences in open
quotient between the two laryngeal mechanisms are also obvious in these examples, except in the case of tenor T1. The
greatest difference is found for soprano S2, with O q ⫽0.54 in
M1 and 0.8 in M2. In this case, mean vocal intensity is 81
dB in M1 and 88 dB in M2.

III. RESULTS

This part presents the results of the open-quotient measurements. We will first deal with its relation to the laryngeal
mechanisms and then explore the correlation with vocal intensity and fundamental frequency.
A. Open quotient and laryngeal mechanism

Several performing situations have been studied with regard to the open-quotient variation from one mechanism to
another: on spoken and sung sentences, within the same
pitch on sustained vowels, and during a glissando, i.e., a
variation of fundamental frequency. As performing a task in
both mechanisms was not obligatory, only a few cases are
presented here, and they relate mainly to male voices.
1. Spoken and sung sentences

The results concerning the mean variation of open quotient during the French sentence, either spoken, shouted, or
sung, are illustrated in Fig. 2. It should be noted that a given
singer did not necessarily produce the three tasks 共speech,
singing, and shouting兲 using both mechanisms. For instance,
it may be easier for a male singer to speak than to sing in
mechanism 2 共M2兲. The three baritones and the tenor, whose
results are plotted in Fig. 2, did not succeed in singing the
sentences in both mechanisms. In most cases, vocal intensity
is kept rather constant between M1 and M2, the differences

2. Sustained vowels

The use of one mechanism or another often goes with a
change of fundamental frequency. However, counter tenor
CT1 sang three sustained vowels 关a兴, 关e兴, and 关u兴 in both
mechanisms on the same pitch 共D4, 293 Hz兲. The results are
given in Table II and illustrated in Fig. 4 in the case of vowel

acterized by a mean value of open quotient of 0.64 and
mechanism 2 by a mean value of 0.77. These results are very
similar to those obtained by this subject during the sung
sentence 共see Fig. 2兲. Mean vocal intensity is 88 dB in M1
and 79 dB in M2. The spectral analysis shows a noticeable
decrease of energy in the high-frequency part of the spectrum in M2. Nevertheless, both phonations were judged as
perceptually similar by the authors.

3. Glissandos

Transitions between laryngeal mechanisms have also
been explored with regard to the laryngeal mechanisms. In
the case of male singers, a transition from M1 to M2 usually
occurs in the higher part of their vocal range: cases where the
vocalis muscle is tensed and subglottal pressure is high
共Miller, 2000兲, hence the probability of a noticeable frequency jump 共Miller et al., 2002; Roubeau, 1993; Svec
et al., 1999兲 and of a decrease of vocal intensity 共Roubeau,
1993兲. The transition between laryngeal mechanisms can
also be detected by an amplitude change in the envelope of
the EGG and DEGG signal 共Henrich et al., 2003; Roubeau
et al., 1987兲.
A glissando sung by tenor T2 with noticeable frequency
jumps is presented in Fig. 5. The transition M1→M2 goes
with a frequency jump of 3 semitones 共F4#→A4兲, and the
transition M2→M1 goes with a frequency jump of 5– 6
semitones 共F4→C4兲. These results are in agreement with
those obtained from three tenors by Miller et al. 共2002兲 in
studying the characteristic leap interval from chest register
共M1兲 to falsetto 共M2兲.
These pitch jumps go together with noticeable jumps of
open quotient. During the transition M1→M2, open quotient
varies from 0.4 to 0.62 within approximately 300 ms, and
this slow variation precedes the jump in frequency. Similar
observations were made by Miller et al. 共2002兲, who found
that the variation in open quotient lasted about 100 ms. The
variation of open quotient for the transition M2→M1 is simiJ. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005

lar in amplitude, O q decreasing from 0.75 to 0.53, but more
sudden.
In classical singing, singers who need to develop their
vocal range over the two laryngeal mechanisms 共such as
male and female altos兲 learn how to ‘‘smooth’’ the transition
from one mechanism to another, so as to avoid any noticeable timbre discontinuity in the melodic line. This is best
illustrated by counter tenor CT1, whose glissando is presented in Fig. 6: the frequency jump is unnoticeable. Both
transitions are characterized by a noticeable decrease in vocal intensity and high-frequency spectral energy, and by a

change in the EGG and DEGG overall amplitude. Nevertheless, the transitions are barely audible at first listening. The
open quotient varies from 0.62 to 0.78 at the transition
M1→M2 and from 0.76 to 0.6 at the transition M2→M1.
The open-quotient variations are reduced as compared to the
case of the tenor T2, but they are still noticeable. A strong
negative correlation can be observed between open quotient
and fundamental frequency in M2. Such a tendency is found
for all the glissandos sung by this singer, the other two
counter tenors, the two tenors 共see for instance Fig. 5兲, and
the three sopranos. This point will be addressed later in Sec.
III C.
The open-quotient variation close to a transition of laryngeal mechanisms is a common feature observed for all the
singers, male and female. The amplitude of the jump ranges
from 0.1 to 0.3. An extensive quantitative analysis of the
open-quotient jump in glissandos is beyond the scope of this
present study, and we will see in the following sections that
many factors contribute to a variation of open quotient.
B. Open quotient and vocal intensity

The measures presented here result from the analysis of
crescendos–decrescendos and sustained vowels sung at three
degrees of loudness, performed at various pitches covering
the singer’s vocal range, and the analysis of Ave Maria musical phrases.
1. Crescendos – decrescendos and sustained vowels

A crescendo–descrescendo sung by baritone B1 on the
vowel 关a兴 at pitch C4 共260 Hz兲 is shown in Fig. 7. A strong
correlation between open quotient and vocal intensity can be
observed: the greater the vocal intensity, the lower the open
quotient. A 20-dB increase of vocal intensity goes along with
a decrease of open quotient from 0.7 to 0.5. It goes along
with a spectral enhancement of the first formant region and
an increase of the harmonic richness in the high-frequency
part of the spectrum. This crescendo–decrescendo was produced in mechanism 1. A crescendo in mechanism 2 sung by

increases by about 10 dB and open quotient remains stable at
about 0.7.
In both cases, pitch is kept constant, suppressing possible dependency between vocal intensity and fundamental
frequency. As compared to ordinary speech, the singing technique comprises the ability to change from soft to loud while
keeping the pitch constant, and to change pitch while maintaining loudness under control. But, this is only true within a
given pitch range. On a voice range profile or phonetogram,
a strong correlation exists between the variations of vocal
intensity and fundamental frequency 共Gramming et al.,
1988; Liénard and Di Benedetto, 1999; Titze and Sundberg,
1992兲, though these two parameters can be modified locally
in an independent way. This general tendency is observed
here as well, as illustrated in Table III: the data resulting
from the analysis of crescendos–decrescendos and sustained
vowels have been pooled across vocal intensity and fundamental frequency, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient between these two variables has been calculated, with the laryngeal mechanism and the vowel as additional parameters.
The correlation between vocal intensity and fundamental frequency seems even stronger in mechanism 2 than in mechanism 1. A few exceptions to this general trend can, however,

While comparing open quotient and vocal intensity at
different pitches, we should thus always keep in mind that
the variation of vocal intensity may be due to a variation of
fundamental frequency. So as to take this possible underlying
variation into account in the statistical analysis of our results,
we shall introduce a partial correlation coefficient 共see the

baritone singers. The trend is similar for the six baritones
共B1 to B6兲, the tenor T2, and the counter tenors CT1 and
CT2: the open quotient decreases as vocal intensity increases. A strong partial correlation (r⬎0.70) is found for
singers B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, T2, and CT2 in the case of
vowel 关a兴, for singers B2, B3, B6, and CT2 in the case of
vowel 关e兴, and for singers B3, B6, and CT2 in the case of
vowel 关u兴. The nature of the vowel may have an effect on
glottal open phase, but this effect is not further explored in
the present study.
The results of the two baritones B4 and B7 and of the
tenor T1 differ from those of the other singers. In the case of
B4, the variations in open quotient are limited, ranging from
0.35 to 0.5 whatever the pitch and vocal intensity. In the case
of B7, the open quotient ranges mainly from 0.4 to 0.55 and
it seldom goes beyond 0.6. For a given vocal intensity, the
results of these two baritones are similar. In the case of T1,
the variations of open quotient are limited, with values ranging from 0.65 to 0.85. Such values are much more often
found in the case of vocal production in mechanism 2.

tenors, the three mezzo-sopranos, and the three sopranos兲.
Table V gives the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients.
No strong correlation is observed. A change of sign is
even observed between Pearson’s correlation coefficient and
the partial correlation coefficient in the case of the three
counter tenors, the mezzo-soprano MS1, and the soprano S1.
In the case of the three counter tenors, for instance, the trend
is a decrease of open quotient with an increase of vocal intensity, with regard to the Pearson correlation coefficient.
The opposite trend is found if the underlying variation of
fundamental frequency is taken into account with the partial
correlation coefficient. It could be explained by the strong
correlation between fundamental frequency and vocal intensity 共a summary of the data is found in Table III兲.

baritones, the two tenors, and one counter tenor. The bars give the standard
deviations for both parameters. No result can be given in the case of baritone B3, for whom the three corresponding DEGG signals present a doublepeak feature at glottal opening almost throughout the phrase.

In mechanism 2, great differences of behavior are observed across singers, and, in each case, these behaviors
agree with the trend pointed out by the partial correlation
coefficient in the case of crescendos–decrescendos and sustained vowels. A decrease of open quotient with an increase
of vocal intensity is found for singers MS1, MS3, and S3. On
the contrary, an increase of open quotient with vocal intensity is found for singers CT3 and S1. No noticeable trend
comes out for singers CT2 in mechanism 2, MS2, and S2.

The singers sang the first bars of Gounod’s Ave Maria,
using various degrees of vocal loudness 共piano, mezzo-forte,

measured over the whole length of the musical sentence are
given in Fig. 11 for mechanism 1 and Fig. 12 for mechanism
2. In mechanism 1, the trend is similar to the one previously
observed in the case of crescendos–decrescendos and sustained vowels: the open quotient decreases when the vocal
intensity increases. Similarly to what was observed in the
previous section, this trend is strong in the case of singers
B1, B2, B6, T2, and CT2, and it is not found in the case of
singers B4, B7, and T1.
A paired samples t-test 共Daudin et al., 1999兲 conducted

C. Open quotient and fundamental frequency

As shown in Fig. 6, a strong correlation between open
quotient and fundamental frequency can be observed on the
glissando sung by counter tenor CT1 in mechanism 2. Although less obvious, such a correlation can also be observed
in the case of the glissando sung by tenor T2 in mechanism 2
共see Fig. 5兲. This correlation seems to depend on the laryngeal mechanism, as it is not found in the parts of the glissandos sung in mechanism 1. We will now try to characterize
this correlation between open quotient and fundamental frequency with regard to the laryngeal mechanisms, in analyzing the measurements made on the sustained vowels and the
crescendos–decrescendos sung at different pitches. It should
be mentioned that, in the present study, the glissandos were
only used to illustrate the relation between open quotient and
fundamental frequency, and that the corresponding data have
not been used for statistical analysis. Indeed, the glissandos
have not been recorded for the purpose of proper statistical
analysis, and in particular, the frequency range and the vowel
have been left to the singer’s choice, which implies that the
glissandos do not cover the whole frequency range of a given
singer in a given laryngeal mechanism. In addition, we were
interested to see whether different loudness conditions would
affect the relation, and this point could not be studied on
glissandos, where the loudness is less easily controlled by
the singer.

Nevertheless, ‘‘singer-dependent’’ behavior can be noticed. A
high positive partial correlation is found between O q and f 0
1426

J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005

in the case of baritones B3 and B7, and counter tenor CT2,
for whom an increase of fundamental frequency goes together with an increase in open quotient. In the case of singers B3 and CT2, this effect of an increase in open quotient
together with an increase of fundamental frequency is compensated for by the effect of an underlying increase of vocal
intensity 共related to a decrease in open quotient in M1兲, as
Pearson’s correlation is low whereas partial correlation is
high.
b. Vocal production in mechanism 2. Table VII gives the
Pearson correlation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients between open quotient and fundamental frequency in
the case of the counter tenors in mechanism 2, the mezzosopranos, and the sopranos. A strong correlation between O q
and f 0 is observed in the case of the three counter tenors and
the sopranos S1 and S2, which confirms the observations
made on the glissandos. An increase of fundamental frequency goes along with a decrease of open quotient. No
correlation is found in the case of soprano S3. The mezzosopranos present an inverse correlation, i.e., an increase of
open quotient with an increase of fundamental frequency, but
this effect is not strong.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. A strong dependency on laryngeal mechanisms

The results converge to confirm that the open quotient is
dependent on the laryngeal mechanism used during the vocal
production: open quotient values are lower in mechanism 1
than in mechanism 2. These differences may reflect the
physiological differences between both laryngeal mechanisms, with regard to the thickness, the vibratory length, and
the tension of the vocal folds. Thus, one can infer that, in
those studies where the open quotient is a parameter of interest, it is of great importance to specify the laryngeal
mechanism in which the voiced sound is produced.
The results of tenor T1 are surprising, as no difference is
found between M1 and M2 共see Fig. 3兲. His vocal production
is often considered as ‘‘voix mixte’’ 共mixed voice兲 by his
singing teachers. The analysis of his vocal production shows
that this singer is always using high values of open quotient
Henrich et al.: Glottal open quotient in singing

(O q ⭓0.7), even during the glissandos with noticeable voice
breaks. This result suggests that, in the case of this tenor, the
so-called voix mixte could be characterized by the use of
mechanism 1 but with unusually high values of open quotient so as to mimic the voice quality of mechanism 2. Further investigation is needed to characterize this vocal production, which is presently under study 共Castellengo et al.,
2004; Chuberre, 2000; Expert, 2003兲.
Can the open quotient be considered as an indicator of
the laryngeal mechanism? In most cases, the laryngeal
mechanism predicts the open-quotient range. Nevertheless,
the results of tenor T1 show that the open-quotient measure
alone does not suffice to determine which laryngeal mechanism is involved in a given vocal production. Indeed, there is
a degree of overlap between the O q ranges corresponding to
laryngeal mechanisms M1 and M2. For this purpose, openquotient measurement should be combined with other means
of characterization, such as listening to and analysis of the
acoustic signal, and visualization of EGG or DEGG signals.
B. Correlation between open quotient and vocal
intensity in M1

The results show that vocal intensity tends to be negatively correlated with open quotient in mechanism 1, for
singing exercises 共sustained vowels and crescendos–
decrescendos兲, as well as for one musical sentence. This
trend is not found in the case of mechanism 2, where the
opposite trend can even be observed for some singers.
These results are in agreement with the observations of
Dromey et al. 共1992兲; Holmberg et al. 共1988兲; Kitzing and
Sonesson 共1974兲; Orlikoff 共1991兲; Sundberg et al. 共1999b兲;
and Timcke et al. 共1958兲. As these previous studies were
conducted with different exploratory methods 共high-speed
cinematography, photoglottography, electroglottography,
inverse-filtered glottal flow兲, it underlines the agreement
found between these methods and the measurement method
based on the derivative of the EGG signal in the case of
singing.
An increase in vocal intensity results from many factors,
and these results suggest that the strategies used for increasing vocal intensity in mechanism 1 differ in some aspects
from the ones used in mechanism 2. Whichever laryngeal
mechanism is considered, an increase in vocal intensity generally results from an increase of subglottal pressure 共Gauffin
and Sundberg, 1989; Holmberg et al., 1988; Isshiki, 1964;
Karlsson, 1986; Ladefoged and McKinney, 1963; Lecuit and
Demolin, 1998a,b; Schutte, 1980; Sundberg et al., 1993;
Tanaka and Gould, 1983; Titze and Sundberg, 1992兲. On the
other hand, the activity of the vocalis muscle is strongly
dependent on the laryngeal mechanism involved 共Hirano,
1982; Roubeau, 1993兲. In mechanism 1, the vocalis contraction directly affects the glottal vibratory movement, and thus
can have an impact on vocal intensity. In the highest part of
mechanism 1, this muscle reaches its physiological limit of
contraction. Thus, in mechanism 2, the tension of this muscle
is reduced, whereas the crico-thyroid muscles are more activated 共Hirano, 1982兲. The decrease in open quotient observed in mechanism 1 may thus be induced by the contraction of the vocalis muscle when vocal intensity is increased.
J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005

This hypothesis accounts for the results obtained in mechanism 2, where the action of the vocalis muscle is limited and
no correlation is found between open quotient and vocal intensity.
C. Correlation between open quotient and
fundamental frequency in M2

In mechanism 2, a strong correlation between open quotient and fundamental frequency is found in the case of the
counter tenors and the sopranos: an increase of fundamental
frequency goes along with a decrease of open quotient. In
mechanism 1, the open quotient seems not to be correlated to
fundamental frequency. These results are in agreement with
the observations made by Howard 共1995兲; Howard et al.
共1990兲, who noticed a decrease of open quotient with an
increase of fundamental frequency in the case of trained female singers, and no correlation between these two parameters in the case of male singers. A comparison between previous studies and the present findings suggests that the
gender differences reported in those studies can in fact be
ascribed to a difference in the laryngeal mechanism involved, as also suggested by Holmberg et al. 共1989兲: male
subjects generally phonate in mechanism 1; female subjects
more often phonate in mechanism 2.
Howard 共1995兲 found that the correlation between open
quotient and fundamental frequency observed on female
singers is dependent on vocal training. The correlation is
weak for the untrained female singers and it increases with
the years of training. This could explain the results obtained
in the case of the three mezzo-sopranos, who are not professional singers and had fewer years of training than the other
singers recorded for this study.
In a few cases for male singers in M1, an increase of
open quotient goes with an increase of fundamental frequency. This trend has already been observed by Childers
et al. 共1990兲; Cookman and Verdolini 共1999兲; Hanson et al.
共1990兲; Holmberg et al. 共1989兲; and Kitzing and Sonesson
共1974兲. However, the fundamental frequency is often highly
correlated with the vocal intensity. As the open quotient decreases with an increase of vocal intensity in mechanism 1,
this effect may compensate for an increase due to fundamental frequency and reduce in most cases the correlation between O q and f 0 .
D. Smoothing the transition between laryngeal
mechanisms

As shown in Fig. 6, counter tenor CT1 managed to
smooth the transition between laryngeal mechanisms,
whereas the glissando sung by tenor T2 共see Fig. 5兲 is a good
illustration of an abrupt transition. Prior to the transition
(M 1→M 2), the major difference between the two cases is
that the counter tenor sings at a lower vocal intensity (I
⯝72 dB) and has higher open-quotient values 共between 0.6
⭐O q ⭐0.7) than the tenor (I⯝95 dB and 0.4⭐O q ⭐0.5).
The correlation between vocal intensity and open quotient in
M1 implies that a decrease of vocal intensity in M1 close to
the laryngeal mechanism transition goes along with an increase of open quotient. If the open-quotient values between
Henrich et al.: Glottal open quotient in singing

1427

M1 and M2 are similar, the jump in open quotient at the
transition is then reduced. This may help the singer to avoid
the jump in fundamental frequency, and thus any perceptual
voice break. Therefore, it seems that the smoothing of a transition between laryngeal mechanisms results from a lowering
of vocal intensity prior to the transition and an increase of
open quotient, so as to reach the value range which is common to both mechanisms.
This ‘‘smoothing’’ technique can be used by any skilled
singer, e.g., tenor T2, who can also sing the glissandos without any voice breaks.
V. CONCLUSION

In this study, 18 trained male and female singers were
recorded and their vocal production was analyzed with regard to the open quotient and its correlation with vocal intensity and fundamental frequency. This study shows the importance of taking into account the laryngeal mechanism in
which the vocal sound is produced. The open quotient can be
seen as an indicator of the laryngeal mechanism within a
given voice production. Lower values of open quotient are
usually found in mechanism 1, as compared to mechanism 2:
the open quotient ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 in mechanism 1 and
from 0.5 to 0.95 in mechanism 2. Yet, one should not rely
solely on the values of open quotient to determine which
laryngeal mechanism is used as there is a degree of overlap
between the O q ranges corresponding to laryngeal mechanisms M1 and M2. Listening to the corresponding sound
samples can provide additional information and help to characterize a given vocal production. Nevertheless, the ear can
sometimes be tricked by the vocal technique of the singer.
For this reason, a combination of analysis, listening, and
measuring of open quotient and other acoustical and EGG
parameters is usually required to determine which laryngeal
mechanism is being used.
The link between open quotient and vocal intensity depends on the laryngeal mechanism. In mechanism 1, they
tend to be correlated: the greater the vocal intensity, the
lower the open quotient. No correlation is found in mechanism 2. This effect could result from the activity of the vocalis muscle, which is reduced in mechanism 2 as compared
to mechanism 1.
In the same way, the link between open quotient and
fundamental frequency is also dependent on the laryngeal
mechanisms. There tends to be a correlation in mechanism 2:
the higher the fundamental frequency, the lower the open
quotient. This correlation varies a bit from subject to subject.
It is especially strong in the case of the counter tenors. No
correlation was found in mechanism 1.
Another repeated observation is the large amount of
variation across subjects. The same observation had already
been made by Schutte 共1980兲 when studying vocal efficiency. Differences in behavior are noticeable among singers
within the same tessitura as well as between tessituras. In
particular, only two tenors were recorded and their behaviors
diverged markedly. It would be of great interest to record
more singers within a given tessitura, in order to generalize
the trends observed in the present study.

APPENDIX: PARTIAL CORRELATION COEFFICIENT

Given the variables x and y measured for n samples and
their mean values x̄ and ȳ, Pearson’s correlation coefficient

.

It happens that the measured correlation between two
variables x and y is due to the underlying variation of a third
variable z 共Saporta, 1990兲. In this case, the calculation of a
partial correlation coefficient should help to eliminate this
underlying variation. The partial correlation coefficient between the variables x and y which takes into account the
underlying variation of the variable z is given by Dagnelie

.

In our study, fundamental frequency and vocal intensity
are strongly correlated, which could bias the correlation calculated between open quotient and these two variables. Thus,
the calculation of a partial correlation coefficient helps to
factor out the effect of this strong correlation.
The degrees of freedom corresponding to the correlation
coefficients are given in Table VIII. In each case, the degree
of freedom is very high, being greater than 200.

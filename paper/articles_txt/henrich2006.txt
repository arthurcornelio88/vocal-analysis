Mirroring the voice from Garcia to the present day: Some insights
into singing voice registers

Abstract
Starting from Garcia’s definition, the historical evolution of the notion of vocal registers from then until now is considered.
Even though much research has been carried out on vocal registers since then, the notion of registers is still confused in the
singing voice community, and defined in many different ways. While some authors consider a vocal register as a totally
laryngeal event, others define it in terms of overall voice quality similarities. This confusion is reflected in the multiplicity of
labellings, and it lies in the difficulty of identifying and specifying the mechanisms distinguished by these terms. The concept
of laryngeal mechanism is then introduced, on the basis of laryngeal transition phenomena detected by means of
electroglottography. It helps to specify at least the laryngeal nature of a given singing voice register. On this basis, the main
physiological, acoustic, and perceptual characteristics of the most common singing voice registers are surveyed.

Key words: Laryngeal mechanism, singing voice, vocal register

Introduction
Before the nineteenth century, knowledge about
human phonation was limited to what could be
perceived by auditory perception and proprioceptive
sensations, or observed from outside during phonation and inside on cadavers. The singing voice
registers are a known fact, related to perception of
different voice qualities. In this context, the singing
voice teacher Manuel Garcia II (1805 /1906) shows
not only an interest in the voice sound quality but
also in the underlying vocal physiology mechanisms.
On November 16th, 1840, he presented the results
of his observations as a voice teacher and his
experiments on the human voice to the French
Académie des Sciences (1), prior to the publication
of his famous singing voice method Ecole de Garcia:
Traité complet de l’art du chant (2). In this paper, he
claims that the human voice is composed of different
registers: poitrine (chest), fausset-tête (falsetto-head),
and contre-basse (counter bass). He defines the
registers as follows: ‘By the word register we mean
a series of consecutive and homogeneous tones going
from low to high, produced by the same mechanical

principle, and whose nature differs essentially from
another series of tones equally consecutive and
homogeneous produced by another mechanical
principle. All the tones belonging to the same
register are consequently of the same nature, whatever may be the modifications of timbre or of the
force to which one subjects them’.1 Therefore,
Garcia pioneers the definition of vocal registers in
relation to a given mechanical principle, independently of any timbre variation. In his definition of
vocal registers, the concept of a mechanical principle
prevails over the perceptual dimension. Basing his
rationale on physiological observations of the larynx
position, he demonstrated that the falsetto and head
registers result from the same laryngeal mechanism,
their difference being a timbre effect.2
Nowadays, we have experimental techniques to
which Garcia did not have access at that time. How
has the knowledge about singing voice registers
evolved since Garcia’s time? How are the vocal
registers defined and identified? What are their
physiological, acoustic and perceptual attributes?
By reviewing the historical evolution of the notion
of vocal register, this paper aims to provide a possible

guide for a better understanding of this notion. A
brief overview of the evolution of definition, numbers and labellings will be given. The different means
of identifying a vocal register will be discussed, and
the concept of laryngeal mechanism will be introduced, on the basis of laryngeal transition phenomena. Finally, the most common singing voice
registers will be reviewed, and their physiological,
acoustic and perceptual properties will be given.
Historical evolution of the notion of vocal
register since Garcia
From Garcia to the present time, the notion of vocal
registers has evolved in many ways. In particular, this
evolution concerns the definition of a vocal register,
the number of registers identified and their labelling.

From Garcia to the 1960s
As mentioned in the introduction, the singing
teacher Manuel Garcia in 1847 is considering three
main different registers, chest , falsetto-head and
contre-basse , the other possible registers, such as
voix mixte , sharing similar mechanical principle
with these main ones (for a detailed discussion about
Garcia’s falsetto-head register, we refer the reader to
(3)). The frequency ranges of these registers are
shown in Figure 1. Interested in understanding the
physiology of these registers, Garcia explores his own
larynx and those of a few of his students by using a
laryngoscope, a clever observation tool which would
give rise to our present endoscopic camera. It

consists of a small mirror fixed to the end of a long
handle and placed at the back of the throat (see
Figure 2). When the throat is lighted in the proper
way, the glottis may be observed from above. The
laryngoscope was already available in the early
nineteenth century */Babington used it in 1827
(4) */so Garcia did not invent it, but he was the
first to use it successfully, being able not only to see
the vocal folds at rest, but also in the act of singing.
Garcia’s observations were communicated to the
Royal Society by Dr Sharpey on May 24th, 1855
(4,5).
In 1880, the physiologist and voice production
teacher Emil Behnke and the throat surgeon Lennox
Browne also made use of the laryngoscope to obtain
in vivo images of the glottis. Behnke defines the vocal
registers as follows: ‘a register consists of a series of
tones which are produced by the same mechanism.
[. . .] There are, broadly speaking, three registers in
the human voice, and the mechanisms are plainly
visible, as follows: 1) During the lowest series of
tones the vocal ligaments vibrate in their entire
thickness. 2) During the next series of tones the
vocal ligaments vibrate only with their thin inner
edges. 3) During the highest series of tones a portion
of the vocal chink is firmly closed, and only a small
part of the vocal ligaments vibrates.’ ((4), p. 86). In
this definition, similarly to Garcia’s, the concept of
laryngeal mechanisms is underlying. On the basis of
these physiological observations, he adopts Curwen’s
thick , thin and small labelling, and he describes three
registers for the male voice (lower thick , upper thick
and upper thin ) and five registers for the female voice

labelled as medium , mid , middle , or mixed register. It
may correspond to the French voix mixte or the
Italian voce mista . Two additional registers are
mentioned at the extreme low and high ends of the
frequency range: the Strohbass register, and the bell ,
flute or whistle register.

(lower thick, upper thick , lower thin , upper thin and
small ). Their corresponding frequency ranges are
shown in Figure 1. The transition between thick and
thin registers is characterized by a break which
occurs around F4 or F4# in both male and female
voices, individual differences apart.
In the early twentieth century, whereas few singing
teachers maintain that a ‘natural’ voice has only one
single register (6,7), the general tendency is to accept
the existence of at least two and at maximum five
registers. The term ‘register’ is even sometimes
replaced by ‘mechanism’, for example by Wilcox
(6,7) who suggests the terms ‘heavy mechanism’ and
‘light mechanism’.
The terms used to label the vocal registers are
abundant and author dependent, and most of the
time their usage is ambiguous. In 1963, a literature
survey summary concerning the pitch range and
labelling of voice registers (8) mentions that ‘the only
secure common denominator for defining a register
is by means of its range on the musical scale.’
Reasonable agreement is found on ‘the average pitch
of the boundaries between registers, i.e. the breaks or
voice transitions.’ It is also mentioned that these
average boundaries do not vary much with the type
of voice, and that the nature of the breaks is ‘still a
matter of controversy’.
The two most common registers are labelled as
chest register and head or falsetto register. The
distinction between head and falsetto is very much
author dependent. In his time, Garcia placed the
falsetto register between chest and head register, and
it may thus correspond to a middle register, as
suggested by Vennard (7). Yet, when the head
register is recognized as a distinct register, it is very
often placed between chest and falsetto. Otherwise,
either it is put aside, or it replaces the falsetto
register, in the case of female voice for instance.
The two main registers overlap in a frequency region
where a third register is sometimes mentioned, and

From the early 1960s to the 1980s, a good deal of
research effort was dedicated to the understanding of
the acoustic, mechanical, and physiological properties of these registers. Working on excised larynges,
the physicist Janwillem Van den Berg 1963 explored
the vibratory pattern of the vocal folds and the
influence of the subglottal resonance. He came to
the conclusion that the mid register may not be
considered as a distinct register (9). The physician
Minoru Hirano, together with two voice teachers
William Vennard and John Ohala, investigated the
role of intrinsic laryngeal muscles using electromyography (10). They found that the vocalis muscle is
essential to register regulation, its activity being
greater in heavy register. In particular, the vocalis
muscular activity decreases during a register shift
from heavy to light and increases from light to heavy.
The lateral cricoarytenoid, interarytenoid and cricothyroid muscles also contribute to register regulation, but to a smaller extent.
In 1974, the speech scientist Harry Hollien
reconsiders the definition, numbering and terminology of registers (11). He defines a vocal register ‘as a
series or range of consecutively phonated frequencies
which can be produced with nearly identical vocal
quality and that ordinarily there should be little or no
overlap in fundamental frequency between adjacent
registers. Furthermore, [he maintains] that a voice
register is a totally laryngeal event and, before the
existence of a particular register can be established,
it must be operationally defined: 1) perceptually,
2) acoustically, 3) physiologically and 4) aerodynamically.’ With regard to this definition based on a
laryngeal entity, he considers three major registers,
which have been experimentally validated, and to
which he gives unfamiliar but also ‘uncontaminated’
labels: pulse , modal and loft registers. The pulse
register includes vocal fry, creak and strohbass
registers; the modal register includes chest , head,
low, mid and high ; the loft register is the equivalent of
the phoneticians’ and speech pathologists’ falsetto
register. Their corresponding frequency ranges are
shown in Figure 1. Hollien mentions a fourth
register, the flute, whistle or pipe , which he puts
aside because of a lack of empirical information and
experimental exploration.

Hollien’s significant paper has pointed out the
confusion around the concept of vocal registers
among the voice community, and it may have
contributed to the emergence of an international
discussion. In the late 1970s, spurred on by the
Collegium Medicorum Theatri (CoMeT), an international organization composed of physicians, voice
scientists, voice coaches and voice pathologists, a
committee on vocal registers was formed in an
attempt to clarify the notion of vocal registers and
to find a consensual position among the international voice community. The committee agreed on
five points, which are reported by Hollien (12):
1. Registers exist: voice registers exist in the
speaking and singing voice, and they ‘must be
recognized as an entity’. Their perceived acoustic effects may be compensated for by appropriate training, if this ‘is considered desirable’.
2. Singing/speaking registers: ‘vocal registers in
singing and voice registers in speaking (or in the
untrained voice) are different and separate
entities and must be treated as such’. However,
they ‘may overlap in function and probably
have common physiological roots in the larynx’.
3. To ‘remove’ registers: two postulates are stated
by the committee. On the one hand, ‘eliminating or concealing register effects is desirable for
the classical/western, concert/opera mode of
singing’. On the other hand, ‘register effects
can be fundamental to certain types of singing’.
It is also important to keep in mind that ‘voice
registers cannot be removed as they are physiologically given.’
4. The source of registers: First, the committee
has ‘accepted the notion that there probably are
two sources for registers */the larynx and the
vocal tract’. However, this point seems to have
raised a great debate among the committee
members. ‘A substantial minority of the committee argued in favor of the source (of a voice
register) being only laryngeal and that the other
so-called register-like phenomena actually are
some sort of quality/timbre events.’
This latter position is in line with Garcia’s
definition. Unfortunately, no mention of what
defines and identifies a register in the human
voice is given in the report. This may explain
the controversy about the question of the
source of registers. As a consequence, a great
debate was also raised by the labelling question.
5. Labels: The committee has rejected the use of
so called ‘old terms’, and in particular chest and
head which are based upon singers’ sensations.
Two main proposals are made. The first suggestion is to number them: ‘#1: for the very

lowest of registers, probably used only in speaking (old terms: pulse , vocal fry, creak ), #2: that
(low) register, which is used for most speaking
and singing (old terms: modal, chest , normal,
heavy), #3: a high register used primarily in
singing (old terms: falsetto, light , head ), #4: a
very high register usually found only in some
women and children and not particularly relevant to singing (old terms: flute , whistle).’ An
additional register is referred to as ‘#2A’ and
defined as ‘that ‘‘register’’ which is described by
many voice teachers as in the middle of the
frequency range [. . .] (old terms: head , mid ,
middle, upper ).’ The second suggestion is to
favour ‘new terms, generic terms, those that are
clear and easy to understand’, such as the pair
of terms heavy, light , or lower , upper.

From the 1980s to the present time
Despite this great effort at clarification, the voice
community remains divided on the question of vocal
registers. The existence of at least two main laryngeal vibratory mechanisms has been experimentally
validated. Among the speech community, an implicit
agreement is found on three registers (pulse or vocal
fry, modal or chest , and falsetto registers), in relation
to specific laryngeal adjustments. In the singing
voice community, the definition, numbers and
labelling of registers are still a matter of debate,
and they continue to vary among authors. Indeed,
vocal registers have an acoustical and perceptual
reality for singers, which cannot be ignored. On the
one hand, a vocal register is defined by its laryngeal
mechanical properties (13 /15), following in this
sense Garcia, Benhke and Hollien. As an example,
Sakakibara (15) proposes the following definition:
‘the vocal register is a set or range of serial sounds
that are similar in perception and produced by
similar vocal fold vibratory patterns.’ On the other
hand, a vocal register is defined by its characteristic
voice quality, following in this sense Large ((16),
cited in (17)). As an example, Titze mentions that
‘the term ‘‘register’’ has been used to describe
perceptually distinct regions of vocal quality that
can be maintained over some ranges of pitch and
loudness.’((18), p. 253) These two approaches of the
notion of vocal register are sometimes implicitly
combined. In a recent thesis on registers in singing
(17), the singer and voice teacher Donald Miller
points out the distinction between registration defined ‘as an exclusive feature of the voice source’ and
the ‘integrated approach to registration, including
adjustments of the vocal tract, as well as those of the
source’. He chooses the latter approach, but defines
the ‘natural registers’ as registers related mainly to

Mirroring the voice from Garcia to the present day
glottal source adjustments. These natural registers
are designated ‘chest’ and ‘falsetto’, and the author
refers to the ‘chest vibratory pattern’ and ‘falsetto
vibratory pattern’ when emphasizing the voice
source characteristics of a given register. According
to this author, the female voice is divided into five
registers: chest and belting registers, which both have
the chest vibratory pattern, and middle, upper and
flageolet registers, which all have the falsetto vibratory pattern. The male voice is divided into four
registers: chest , full head and mezza voce registers,
which all have the chest vibratory pattern, and
falsetto register, which has the falsetto vibratory
pattern. The corresponding frequency ranges are
shown in Figure 1.

Conclusion: what are the vocal registers?
In his time, Garcia was distinguishing vocal registers
on the basis of a ‘mechanical principle’ which he
related to a laryngeal event. Following Garcia’s path,
other authors, such as Benhke, Hollien or Roubeau,
have explored the concept of laryngeal-related vocal
registers with the help of more and more sophisticated experimental techniques: laryngoscopy, cinematography, electromyography, electroglottography
(EGG), etc. The understanding of laryngeal vibratory mechanisms has become more refined.
Yet, a vocal register classification based only on
laryngeal phenomena does not take into account the
great timbre variations which can be achieved in
singing. This may explain that, even today, the
notion of vocal registers in singing remains very
often a matter of debate among the singing voice
community. Whereas some authors define the registers exclusively on the basis of an underlying
laryngeal mechanical principle, others prefer to
define them on the basis of sound voice quality. In
this context, to find a consensual position on the
labelling of registers is inevitably problematic, but
the core of this problem is less the terminology itself
than the ‘failure to identify and specify the mechanisms distinguished by the terms’, as pointed out by
Miller ((17), p. 32).
In the next section, we will see how the problem of
identifying the mechanisms related to singing voice
registers has been partly solved, at least at the
laryngeal level.
Transition phenomena: how to identify a
laryngeal mechanism
The reason for defining at least two registers in
human phonation comes from the discontinuities or
transition phenomena, which can occur voluntarily
or involuntarily during the production of voiced

7

sounds. Different kinds of transition phenomena
are listed in the literature, in particular periodicity,
timbre, and laryngeal transitions. They will be briefly
presented here. We will then focus on the laryngeal
vibratory mechanisms, the consistency of which is
evinced by laryngeal transition phenomena.

Detection of transition phenomena
A transition phenomenon may result from psychoacoustic properties of human perception. The ‘periodicity transition’ distinguished by Titze (18,19) is
an example of such a transition. It refers to ‘changes
in vocal quality that occur whenever glottal pulses
are perceived as individual events rather than a
continuous auditory stimulus’ (19). According to
this author, it accounts for the distinction between
pulse (or vocal fry ) and chest registers. A given voice
production is perceived as pulsed when its fundamental frequency F0 is lower than a 70-Hz ‘crossover’ frequency, and perceived as non-pulsed above
this frequency. In the case of a F0/n subharmonic
pattern, the crossover frequency is n /70 Hz.
According to Titze, the reason for this perceptual
fact lies in formant energy damping (related to the
formant bandwidth) over the fundamental period:
waveforms are perceived as pulse-like if the formant
energy during one excitation is sufficiently damped
out before the next excitation occurs. This author
defines the pulse-chest registers boundaries on the
basis of this periodicity transition.
Transition phenomena may also result from noticeable timbre variations (17,19,20), which may or
may not be related to a laryngeal adjustment.
According to Titze (18,19), timbre transitions are
characterized by an abrupt voice quality change,
which is associated with a spectral energy change in
the high-frequency part of the sound spectrum, i.e.,
a modification in the spectral slope. This spectral
change may come from a variation in the glottal flow
derivative discontinuity and the return phase, which
can be more or less abrupt. From the acoustic point
of view, it may result from an interference between a
subglottal resonance and the vocal fold driving
pressure.
According to Miller (17), either these transitions
have a laryngeal source, or they result from resonance strategies, also called ‘formant tuning’. In this
latter case, a vocal tract resonance is adjusted to
match a given harmonic in frequency, reinforcing the
energy in this harmonic frequency band. The tuning
process may induce the presence of strong acoustic
standing waves, which in return can affect the vocal
fold vibratory movement, yet in a more subtle way
than in the case of a laryngeal adjustment (17).

It is difficult to give strong evidence of these vocal
tract adjustments, as the vocal tract resonances are
difficult to measure reliably from the acoustic signal,
especially when the harmonic spacing is broad. On
the contrary, the laryngeal transition phenomena,
which are related to a sudden adjustment of the
glottal vibratory pattern, are more easily detectable.
For instance, the pitch jump is the most common
and obvious transition phenomenon which can
occur during male and female phonation, in speech
and singing (13,21 /23). Avoided in the classical
singing technique, it is used as an ornament or even
a singing style in other vocal cultures, such as the
Tyrolean or African yodel (20,24). Evidence has
been given that this transition phenomenon is only
related to a biomechanical laryngeal adjustment, as it
can occur on excised larynges without the presence
of vocal tract loading (25). As illustrated in Figure 3,
a vocal fold is a heterogeneous layered structure
(26), composed of the cover (mucosa, epithelium
and superficial layer of lamina propria), the transition (intermediate and deep layers of lamina propria,
also called vocal ligaments), and the body (vocalis
muscle). The abruptness of the frequency jump is
accounted for by a sudden variation of the vibrating
mass in action, induced by a decoupling of the
vibrating layers due to a modification in vocal fold
tension (13). As this modification in tension may be
gradual, these frequency jumps are considered to be
manifestations of bifurcations in the vocal fold
vibratory mechanism (23).
A noticeable frequency jump often goes with a
jump in the open quotient (21,27), which can be
detected on electroglottographic signals. This jump
occurs, for instance, during the production of a
glissando, as illustrated in Figure 4. The open

quotient jump is one characteristic of a laryngeal
transition. As illustrated in Figure 4, it may occur
even in the case when the singer manages to smooth
the transition, thus avoiding the frequency jump
(27).
Laryngeal transition phenomena can be characterized by a noticeable change in the vocal fold contact
area, which can easily be detected using electroglottography by an abrupt EGG amplitude variation
(22,28). On the basis of these transition phenomena
detected by electroglottography, the concept of
laryngeal mechanism has been defined (13,22,29).
This concept, which is of great help in clarifying the
notion of vocal registers in terms of laryngeal
configuration and glottal vibratory properties, will
now be summarized.

The laryngeal mechanisms
The variation in EGG amplitude which goes with a
noticeable register break (28,30) can similarly be
observed during a register transition without any
noticeable break (22,29). Therefore, a register transition associated with a laryngeal adjustment can
easily be identified by an amplitude change in the
EGG signal, as illustrated in Figure 4. Even when
the singer is skilled enough to smooth the transition,
so that no break or timbre change can be noticed,
the vocal register transition can be detected on the
EGG signal.
On the basis of these laryngeal-transition phenomena, the notion of laryngeal mechanism has been
defined (13,22,29). The choice has been made to
number them, following in this way one of the 1983
CoMeT labelling positions (12). During the production of a glissando from the lowest to the highest
possible pitches, three laryngeal transitions can be
detected, as shown in Figure 5. These transitions
delimit four frequency regions, in which the voice is
produced by the use of a precise laryngeal vibratory
mechanism (laryngeal mechanism M0 to M3).
A laryngeal mechanism can be considered as a
substitute for a vocal register which would totally be
defined as a laryngeal entity. The corresponding
register counterparts of the laryngeal mechanisms
are given in Table I.
The laryngeal mechanisms correspond to different
vocal fold configurations which will now be described. A schematic representation of the two main
ones, M1 and M2, is plotted in Figure 6.
In laryngeal mechanism M0, the vocal folds are
very short and thick, all the layers being slackened
and pliant (11,26). Vocalis, cricothyroid, and interarytenoid muscular activities are minimal, as compared to other laryngeal mechanisms (26,31). The
closed phase is usually very long. The lowest

35% threshold method, and on the DEGG signal, using the DECOM method (55). The determination of the underlying laryngeal
mechanism (M1 or M2) is based on the EGG detected laryngeal transitions.

frequencies are usually produced in this laryngeal
mechanism.
In laryngeal mechanism M1, the vocal folds are
thick and they vibrate over their whole length with a
vertical phase difference (7). Vibrating mass and
amplitude are important. The vocal fold body is
stiffer than the cover and transition (26). Vocalis
muscular activity is dominant over cricothyroid
(26,31). Both activities increase with pitch. Closed
phase is often longer than open phase, which is
reflected in the open or closed quotient values (27).
This laryngeal mechanism is used by both males and
females in the low to mid part of their frequency
range. The corresponding average voice range profiles for males and females are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 5. Illustration of the four laryngeal vibratory mechanisms
on the production of a glissando. The top panel shows the time
frequency analysis, and the bottom one the EGG signal.

In laryngeal mechanism M2, the vibrating mass
and amplitude are reduced (7), as compared to
mechanism M1, and there is no vertical phase
difference in the glottal vibratory movement. All
the vocal fold layers are stretched, and the collagenous fibres in the vocal ligament are the stiffest of all
the layers (26). Cricothyroid muscular activity is
dominant over vocalis. The open phase is always
longer than the closed phase, lasting at least 50% of
the fundamental period (27). This laryngeal mechanism is used by both males and females in the
mid to high part of their frequency range. The
corresponding average voice range profiles for males
and females are shown in Figure 7.
The laryngeal mechanism M3 is far from being
understood. Whistle , flute or flageolet registers may
be produced in mechanism M3, and only few studies
have been dedicated to these registers. In this
mechanism, the vocal folds are thin and very tensed.
The vibratory amplitude is much reduced as compared to mechanism M2, and there even may be no
contact in some cases. It has been suggested that the
vocal fold vibration may be induced by periodic
vortex shedding interacting with the resonator (32).
The laryngeal mechanisms are not related exclusively to speech or singing, but they are a physiological entity in human phonation (22). They are also
common to male and female, who share similar
laryngeal mechanism boundaries (see Figure 7). A
characteristic of the human voice is that the frequency regions of the main mechanisms M1 and M2
can overlap over a precise frequency range (33), as
shown in Figure 7: E3 (165 Hz) to F#4 (370 Hz) for
male voices, and G3 (196 Hz) to G4 (392 Hz) for
female voices. At those pitches, a speaker or singer
can choose to phonate using either mechanism M1

or M2, and this choice may be voluntary or
involuntary. In singing, it may be related to the
singer’s desire to produce a specific voice quality.
Indeed, voice quality is dependent on the glottal flow
properties. Because the laryngeal mechanisms correspond to different vocal fold vibratory mechanisms, they imply large differences in the glottal flow
pulse shape. Their use results in the production of a
specific voice quality in relation to the laryngeal
configuration. However, skilled singers, and in
particular classically trained singers, manage to
modify this typical voice quality, in particular in
adjusting their vocal tract in the proper way. This is
for example the case of voix mixte (mixed voice)
register, as will be seen in the next section.
Insights into the physiological, acoustic, and
perceptual characteristics of singing voice
registers
In this section, a survey of the most common singing
voice registers mentioned in the literature is given. In
each case, their main physiological, acoustic, and
perceptual characteristics are briefly described. The
choice has been made to take the underlying
laryngeal mechanism in which they are produced
as a common denominator for categorizing these
registers. The special case of the middle or voix mixte
register is discussed at the end of the section.

Laryngeal mechanism

small?

Registers produced in laryngeal mechanism M0: pulse,
vocal fry or strohbass
Pulse , vocal fry or strohbass are equivalent labels
(11). They designate the register which occurs in
the lowest part of the human frequency range. This
register is produced in laryngeal mechanism M0.
The vocal folds are very short, thick and slack. A
recent survey of the acoustic, aerodynamic, physiological, and perceptual characteristics of this register in speech can be found in (34). From a
physiological point of view, the thyroarytenoid
muscles tend to shorten, subsequently thickening
the anterior-posterior dimension of the vocal folds,
and allowing the anterior part of the vocal ligaments to vibrate (11). The glottal vibratory pattern
is characterized by short pulses, which can be
periodic and single, periodic and multiple (double,
triple), or aperiodic (single and multiple) (34 /36).
The pulses are followed by a long closed interval
(36,37), which implies small values of open quotient. The frequency range goes from a few Hz to
about 80 Hz with a mean of 50 Hz, and is similar
for males and females (34,38). This register is more
commonly found in speech than in singing. However, few exceptions can be found in certain vocal
cultures around the world (e.g., Russian and Papua
New Guinea folk music, rhythm and blues singing
style, (15)).

Registers produced in laryngeal mechanism M1: modal,
chest, male head, belting
The low to mid frequency part of the voice can be
divided into a single register (in this case modal or
chest register), or into two or more different registers
(chest , male head , belting, voix mixte , voce finta ,. . .).
The modal, chest , male head, belting, and voce finta
registers are produced in laryngeal mechanism M1
(11,13,39,40). The voix mixte register will be described later and can be produced either in M1 or in
M2 (41). The vocal folds are thick, with great
vibrating mass and large vibratory amplitude. The
inverse-filtered glottal-flow pulse is asymmetrical,
the closing phase being shorter than the opening.
The open quotient values range from 0.3 to 0.8,
depending on vocal intensity (27).
The distinction between chest and male head
registers is defined by Miller (42) in terms of vocal
tract adjustment: ‘the chest register comprises the
lower portion of the range, extending to the highest
pitch where the first formant matches the second
harmonic; the head register comprises that portion
of the range where F1 falls below H2.’ The head
register is used in the upper range and spans a
musical interval of a fourth or fifth (39), located in
the vicinity of D4b to A4b for a tenor and B3b to F4
for a baritone (42). Suitable for soft singing, the head
voice is recognized by Vennard as an ‘intermediate
adjustment, (. . .), easily confused with falsetto
but continuous with full voice’ ((7), paragraph
935). From a laryngeal muscular point of view,
head register is characterized by higher cricothyroid
activity and lower vocalis activity than chest (26).
Yet, it is clearly produced in laryngeal mechanism
M1. As pointed out by Large (39), it is ‘a different laryngeal mechanism from falsetto’, with
complete vocal fold approximation, greater energy
in the higher partials and lower air flow rate than
falsetto.

Belting is very often considered as a technique of
loud singing commonly found in non-classical singing, with a voice quality similar to a yell (40,43 /45).
However, a few authors consider it nowadays as a
vocal register on its own (17), and thus it seems that
it is worth mentioning here. It could be produced by
males and females, but only female voices have been
studied up to now. Considered as an extension of
chest register into the upper part, its frequency range
goes from E4 /G4 (about 330 Hz) to D5 (540 Hz)
(40). Belting sounds are produced with high subglottal pressure, long closed phase of duration
greater than half of the fundamental period, high
SPL, and great harmonic richness (40,43,46). A
tuning of the first formant with the second harmonic
has been observed on open vowels (40,43).
Registers produced in laryngeal mechanism M2: falsetto,
loft, female head, upper
The falsetto, loft, and female head are equivalent
labels for registers which occur in the mid to high
frequency part of the voice. The falsetto register can
be used to designate altogether a female-like voice
quality produced by males, in particular counter
tenors, a soft and breathy fake voice quality produced by untrained male singers in the high range,
and the female mid to high register, or female head
register.
All these registers are produced in laryngeal
mechanism M2. The vocal folds are thin and the
vibrating mass and vibratory amplitude are reduced.
The inverse filtered glottal flow pulse is more
symmetrical, close to a sinusoidal shape. The open
quotient values are high, ranging from 0.5 to 0.95
depending on the fundamental frequency (27).
Their main acoustic characteristic is the predominance of the first harmonic, in relation to high values
of the open quotient (47).
In the female case, the mid to high frequency part
of the voice may be divided into two or more

12

N. Henrich

registers, for instance lower middle, upper middle, and
upper (48). The boundary between middle and upper
registers is located around D5 to F5 (17). According
to Miller (17), the main differences between these
registers lie in the resonance strategies adopted by
the singer. When the fundamental frequency is
getting high enough to be close to the first formant,
there is a tendency to tune the first formant to the
first harmonic, and to maintain this tuning for higher
pitches (49/51). The F1-H1 tuning on open vowels
would be the determinative feature of the upper
register (17).
Registers produced in laryngeal mechanism M3: bell,
flute, whistle, flageolet
The bell, flute , whistle, or flageolet are equivalent
labels for a register which occurs in the highest part
of the human frequency range (52). It is produced in
laryngeal mechanism M3. However, the phonatory
mechanism has not been explored much. There may
be several types of realization (15). Only a few
studies have paid attention to this register, which is
not much used in speech and classical singing,
except in the high soprano range (48). It can be
found in non-classical singing styles, such as jazz or
contemporary music. The fundamental frequency
typically ranges from B5 to F6, i.e., from about 1000
to 1400 Hz (17). The first harmonic is dominant,
and the number of overtones is reduced (52,53).
According to Miller, this register is used when the
fundamental frequency is too high to remain close to
the first formant. The corresponding sound quality
is ‘small and thin’, but nevertheless ‘brilliant’,
comparable to ‘a chime or a sharply-ringing distant
bell’ (48).
What about the registers in the middle of the frequency
range: mid, middle, mixed voice, voix mixte?
A special case are the registers found in the middle of
the human frequency range, and often labelled as
mid , middle, mixed voice, or voix mixte . The term
head can also be found (18), and the female middle
register can sometimes be considered to be similar to
male full head register (17). Yet, the correspondence
between these terms cannot be stated with certainty.
Singers make use of these registers to smooth the
transition between the lower and upper part of their
frequency range, in the frequency region where the
frequency ranges of laryngeal mechanisms M1 and
M2 overlap. For a long time, it has been queried
whether this register would be a mixture of two
registers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that, at
least from the laryngeal point of view, singers use a
precise laryngeal mechanism, which is either M1 or

M2 (41). Male singers very easily use the laryngeal
mechanism M1 to produce sounds in voix mixte ,
whereas female singers very easily use the laryngeal
mechanism M2. However, examples have also been
studied of a soprano singing in voix mixte register
using laryngeal mechanism M1, or a counter tenor
singing in voix mixte register using laryngeal mechanism M2 (41).
The resonance properties of these registers still
need to be explored, so as to understand how a
singer manages to mimic the voice quality of a given
register while using an inappropriate laryngeal mechanism.
Conclusion
Since Garcia, knowledge about singing voice registers has evolved, thanks to the development of new
experimental techniques. Yet, the controversy about
vocal registers, which already existed in Garcia’s
time, is still present nowadays, and reflected in the
multiplicity of labels for registers. It seems to have its
roots in the definition of a register and its defining
characteristics. If a vocal register is defined as a series
of consecutive tones produced by the same laryngeal
mechanism, the human voice can be characterized
by four different voice registers, i.e., laryngeal
registers such as Hollien’s pulse , modal, loft registers,
and the whistle register. If a vocal register is defined
as series of consecutive tones produced with similar
voice quality, other registers exist in the human
singing voice, such as head, belting , middle, upper,
voix mixte ,. . . One major issue is then to define a
vocal register precisely before labelling it. Another
major issue is to be precise about the means which
are required to identify a given vocal register. The
identification of vocal registers can benefit from
the detection of transition phenomena. In this way,
the concept of laryngeal mechanism, which is based
on the detection of laryngeal transition phenomena
by means of electroglottography, is of great help in
clarifying the laryngeal nature of a given voice
production. At least, the singing voice registers can
now be described in terms of the laryngeal mechanism by which they are produced. Further research is
needed to understand the singers’ resonance strategies and acoustic adaptations which are required to
produce a specific voice quality or to successfully
manage blending of singing voice registers. Furthermore, major voice quality differences are avoided in
the Western lyric culture, whereas they may be a
prime goal in other vocal cultures, such as jazz, blues
and rock. Knowledge of singing voice registers
would gain from a better understanding of these
non-classical phonation types.

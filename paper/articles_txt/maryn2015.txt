Objective Dysphonia Measures in the Program Praat:
Smoothed Cepstral Peak Prominence and Acoustic
Voice Quality Index
*,†,‡Youri Maryn and §David Weenink, *Bruges, yGhent, and zAntwerp, Belgium, and xAmsterdam, The Netherlands
Summary: Purpose. A version of the ‘‘smoothed cepstral peak prominence’’ (ie, CPPS) has recently been implemented in the program Praat. The present study therefore estimated the correspondence between the original CPPS
from the program SpeechTool and Praat’s version of the CPPS. Because the CPPS is the main factor in the multivariate
Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI), this study also investigated the proportional relationship between the AVQI with
the original and the second version of the CPPS.
Study Design. Comparative cohort study.
Methods. Clinical recordings of sustained vowel phonation and continuous speech from 289 subjects with various
voice disorders were analyzed with the two versions of the CPPS and the AVQI. Pearson correlation coefficients and
coefficients of determination were calculated between both CPPS-methods and between both AVQI-methods.
Results. Quasi-perfect correlations and coefficients of determination approaching hundred percent were found.
Conclusions. The findings of this study demonstrate that the outcomes of the two CPPS-methods and the two AVQImethods are highly comparable, increasing the clinical feasibility of both methods as measures of dysphonia severity.

INTRODUCTION
Acoustic methods have a long history in clinical voice assessment. Besides measures of fundamental frequency and sound
intensity to objectify pitch and loudness, respectively,
numerous acoustic markers have been proposed to objectify
dysphonia type and severity.1 Acoustic measurements are
remarkably appealing because of their noninvasiveness, relative
low cost, and ease of application.2 They are able to yield a numerical output, and therefore they consistently permit tracking
of treatment outcomes and communication of this information
to voice clinicians, patients, third-party payers, physicians, and
other stakeholders.3,4 One specific and recently developed
method to quantify the severity of overall dysphonia is the
Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI).
This index has the following attributes. First, the AVQI is
developed to measure dysphonia in both continuous speech and
sustained vowel recordings. Sustained vowels induce a comparatively steady action at subglottal, glottal, and supraglottal levels.
Continuous speech, on the other hand, is characterized by
temporal and spectral variations caused by voice onsets and offsets, interruptions, voiceless phonemes, phonetic context, prosodic modulations in fundamental frequency and intensity, speech
tempo, and so on.2,5,6 Because the vocal behavior differs
considerably between these two voice/speech tasks, perception

of type and severity of dysphonia can be hypothesized to vary
across the kind of speech to be rated. Although two studies7,8
found no statistically significant differences in the auditory
perception of dysphonia severity between sustained vowels and
continuous speech, four other studies6,9–11 revealed that
listeners rate dysphonia, and especially breathiness, more
severely in sustained vowels than in continuous speech. These
findings underline that for perceptual and instrumental methods
in the clinical dysphonia assessment it is essential to record and
analyze sustained vowels and continuous speech. Therefore, the
AVQI requires recordings and measures overall dysphonia
severity of both speech/voice contexts.
Second, the AVQI is a multivariate construct that combines
multiple acoustic markers to yield a single number that correlates
reasonably with overall dysphonia severity. This multiparametric
approach was motivated by the multidimensional nature of voice
quality and the fact that it is not related to a sole physical variable
or a unique psychoacoustical determinant.12 This is in contrast to
pitch and loudness that many authors regard as synonymous to
the distinctive features fundamental frequency and sound intensity, respectively. Kreiman and Gerratt13 for example stated
that vocal quality included all perceptual dimensions of the spectral envelope and its changes in time, and indicated a possibly major role of both time-domain and frequency-domain measures in
the investigation of voice quality. Furthermore, bivariate correlational methods to estimate the proportional relationship between
an auditory-perceptual rating and a single acoustic marker
approach often lacked sufficient strength (see Maryn et al14 for
a meta-analysis on this topic). This prompted many researchers
to apply multivariate statistics and to combine the merits of multiple measures for increased validity of objective/instrumental
analysis of voice quality and/or more accurate discrimination
among different perceptual categories/levels of dysphonia
severity.4,9,15–26 To construct a statistical model representing
the best combination of acoustic predictors for the overall

36
degree of disordered voice, only six from the thirteen acoustic
measures that were initially applied in the study of Maryn
et al4 were retained after stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. The following multiple regression equation that was based
on the unstandardized coefficients of this statistical model was
called the AVQI ¼ 2.571 (3.295 – 0.111 smoothed cepstral
peak prominence " 0.073 harmonics-to-noise ratio " 0.213
shimmer local + 2.789 shimmer local dB " 0.032 slope of the
long-term average spectrum + 0.077 tilt of the trendline through
the long-term average spectrum). This equation thus includes
acoustic markers from the time, frequency, and quefrency domains, and is a multidimensional representation of dysphonia
severity.
Third, the main contributor to the AVQI model is the
smoothed version of the cepstral peak prominence (CPPS).
This measure represents the distance between the first rahmonic
peak and the point with equal quefrency on the regression line
through the smoothed cepstrum. The reasoning behind this
acoustic marker is that the more periodic a voice signal, the
more it displays a well-defined harmonic configuration in the
spectrum (ie, the more harmonic the spectrum), and, consequently, the more the cepstral peak will be prominent. Since
its introduction in the field of voice quality measurement by
Hillenbrand et al27 and Hillenbrand and Houde,28 it has proven
to be a reliable and valid measure of overall voice quality, and
especially breathiness, across a multitude of studies.4,29–37
Additionally, Maryn et al14 performed a meta-analysis on correlation coefficients between auditory-perceptual ratings of
overall dysphonia severity (ie, Grade or G) and 69 acoustic
measures on sustained vowels/26 acoustic measures on continuous speech. Only four acoustic markers on sustained vowels
(ie, Pearson r at autocorrelation peak, pitch amplitude, spectral
flatness of residue signal, and smoothed cepstral peak prominence), and only three acoustic markers on continuous speech
(ie, signal-to-noise ratio based on linear predictive coding and
inverse filtering, cepstral peak prominence, and smoothed cepstral peak prominence) satisfied the meta-analytic criteria and
were considered to be the most promising measures for the
acoustic assessment of overall voice quality. The smoothed
cepstral peak prominence (CPPS), however, was the only
acoustic metric that yielded sufficient concurrent validity in
both sustained vowel and continuous speech, and was therefore
regarded as the superior acoustic measure of dysphonia
severity.14 In combination with the other five acoustic measures
of the AVQI, the CPPS provided a solid basis to objectively/
quantitatively approach dysphonia severity.
Fourth, because the original AVQI was developed with the help
of the freely available and downloadable software packages
‘‘Praat’’ (Paul Boersma and David Weenink; Institute of Phonetic
Sciences, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands—http://
www.praat.org/) and ‘‘SpeechTool’’ (James Hillenbrand; Western
Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA—http://homepages.
wmich.edu/#hillenbr/), it is within reach of most voice clinicians. Furthermore, with the Praat script from Maryn et al,4 it
was possible to automate and standardize most of the sound
formatting and acoustic analyses. The program Praat has the
additional advantage that it offers packages for multiple operating

Journal of Voice, Vol. 29, No. 1, 2015

systems (ie, Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and so on.) and can be
applied regardless the operating system that is used by the voice
and speech clinician.
Fifth, the AVQI has been scrutinized on validity in several
studies since its publication, for example the correlation coefficients (ie, r) were highly comparable across the different studies:
r ¼ 0.780 on two hundred fifty Dutch-speaking subjects,4
r ¼ 0.796 on thirty-nine Dutch-speaking subjects,34 r ¼ 0.794
on one hundred and seven English-speaking subjects,38
r ¼ 0.790 on sixty-one German-speaking subjects,39 and an
averaged r ¼ 0.829 on fifty subjects speaking different languages.40 Pooling these data of 507 subjects across five studies
results in a homogeneous weighted correlation (ie, rw, to credit
the r of large sample studies more than the r of those with a
smaller sample in the calculation of an average r across studies,
the number of subjects is taken into account to weight the
r-values) of rw ¼ 0.790. This finding indicates that the AVQI
is a robust method, insulated from the differences across the languages in these studies, audio recording technology, reliability
of the G-ratings of the experienced/professional listeners in these
studies, or other factors that might affect its proportional relationship with G-ratings.
In conclusion, the AVQI is a multivariate, accessible,
feasible, and reasonably valid method to clinically measure
overall dysphonia severity in sustained vowel and continuous
speech samples. Because the CPPS was only available in the
program SpeechTool and not in the program Praat, the practical
disadvantage of the AVQI was that it required a protocol
combining both programs. This culminated in a relatively
high number of steps in the AVQI procedure: (1) recording
the continuous speech sample, (2) extracting and concatenating
the voiced segments with a customized script in Praat (ie, part
1), (3) recording the medial 3 seconds of [a:] (ie, part 2), (4)
chaining part 2 after part 1 in Praat, (5) determining CPPS in
SpeechTool, (6) determining harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR),
shimmer local (SL), SLdB, Slope, and Tilt with a customized
script in Praat, (7) completing the CPPS in a form in Praat,
and (8) calculating the AVQI with a customized script in Praat
(eg, Maryn et al40). The AVQI protocol was relatively laborious
on that account. However, because the recent implementation
of the cepstral peak prominence measures in Praat (since
version 5.3.53)–with various cepstral applications via the ‘‘To
PowerCepstrogram . ’’ function and the possibility to obtain
the cepstral metric via the ‘‘Get CPPS . ’’ command—it
became also possible to calculate the smoothed cepstral peak
prominence in this program. This new development in Praat
no longer necessitated a combination with SpeechTool, facilitating a single-program (ie, only in the program Praat) and
even a single-script (ie, instead of working with multiple scripts
as before, it became possible to merge all signal processing
steps into only one Praat-macro) solution for the AVQI, minimizing the manual labor for the voice clinician, and therefore
maximizing the AVQI’s feasibility. A new script (ie, a second
version or a beta version) for the AVQI was established to
meet that purpose and will be examined in the present study.
The following two research aims were investigated in the
present study. Because the construction of the power cepstrum

differs between the two programs, it was first estimated how
well the recently implemented CPPS in Praat corresponded
with the original CPPS in SpeechTool (ie, are the CPPS data
in Praat interchangeable with the CPPS data in SpeechTool?).
Consequently, given that the sound signal processing and the
cepstral metric differ between the two programs, this study
also investigated how well the second version of the AVQI
corresponded with the original version of the AVQI (ie, are
data of the second AVQI version transposable with the initial
AVQI data?).
METHODS
The methods of the present study are highly comparable to the
methods of two earlier studies4,34 in terms of subjects. Only the
acoustic cepstral methods and the program to elicit them were
different from the previous studies.
Subjects
This research is based on one pool of voice recordings collected
in two sets of subjects from the ENT caseload of the Sint-Jan
General Hospital in Bruges, Belgium. First, the voice samples
of 22 vocally normal and 228 voice-disordered participants
from the study of Maryn et al4 were used for further analysis.
Second, we used the recordings of six vocally normal and 33
voice-disordered subjects of Maryn et al34 This resulted in a total group of 289 (ie, 28 normophonic and 261 dysphonic) subjects, with 193 females between 10 and 86 years
(mean ¼ 36.8 years, Standard Deviation ¼ 18.4 years) and 96
males between eight and 85 years (mean ¼ 43.0 years, Standard
Deviation ¼ 21.5 years). Table 1 summarizes the variety of laryngoscopic/laryngostroboscopic diagnoses included in the
sample. This study group is regarded as an adequate representation of a voice clinic population, reflecting different ages
and genders and different types and degrees of voice quality
disruption, and including nonorganic as well as organic laryngeal pathologies. Their voices were recorded at the beginning
of a standard voice/larynx assessment.
Voice recordings
All 289 participants were asked to sustain the vowel [a:] for at
least 5 seconds and to read aloud a Dutch phonetically
balanced text41 at comfortable pitch and loudness. Both voice
samples were recorded using an AKG C420 head-mounted
condenser microphone (AKG Acoustics, M€
unchen, Germany),
digitized at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a resolution of
16 bits using the Computerized Speech Lab model 4500
(Kay Elemetrics Corporation, currently known as KayPENTAX, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA), and saved in WAV-format. A
copy of every vowel sample was edited to include only the
medial 3 seconds and a copy of the read text samples was
trimmed to contain only the first two sentences in the program
Praat.
Acoustic measures
Because certain acoustic measures used in this study are only
valid for voiced segments of the continuous speech samples,

segmentation, and concatenation of these voiced segments
was applied. The three-second midvowel segment was appended to this chain of voiced text segments, resulting into a
single sound wave for acoustic analyses.
Seven acoustic markers were determined on these concatenated sound files. First, the HNR was administered in the
program Praat as the base-10-logarithm of the ratio between
the periodic energy and the noise energy multiplied by 10.
Second, the SL was determined in the program Praat as
the absolute mean difference between the amplitudes of successive periods divided by the average amplitude. Third, the
‘‘shimmer local dB’’ (ie, SLdB) was specified in the program
Praat as the base-10-logarithm of the differences between the
amplitudes of successive periods multiplied by 20. Fourth,
the ‘‘general spectral slope’’ (ie, slope) was measured in
the program Praat as the difference between the energy in
the 0–1 kHz range and the energy in the 1–10 kHz range
of the long-term average spectrum. Fifth, the ‘‘spectral trendline inclination’’ (ie, tilt) was computed in the program Praat
as the difference between the energy in the 0–1 kHz range
and the energy in the 1–10 kHz range of the trendline through
the long-term average spectrum. Sixth, the ‘‘smoothed cepstral peak prominence’’ (ie, CPPSSpeechTool) was determined in
the program SpeechTool as the distance between the first rahmonic’s peak and the point with equal quefrency on the

38
regression line through the smoothed cepstrum. Seventh, the
‘‘smoothed cepstral peak prominence’’ (ie, CPPSPraat) was
also determined in the program Praat as the distance between
the first rahmonic’s peak and the point with equal quefrency
on the regression line through the smoothed cepstrum. The
CPPSPraat has just recently been implemented in the program
Praat.
Smoothed cepstral peak prominence: SpeechTool
versus Praat
The methods to yield the CPPS in SpeechTool and Praat are
similar but not equal. Both programs construct a power cepstrum by first taking the logarithm of the amplitude spectrum.
However, instead of taking the inverse Fourier transform of
the log spectrum to obtain the cepstrum as in the Praat application (Weenink, in preparation), the SpeechTool application27,28 takes the forward Fourier transform to obtain the
cepstrum from the log spectrum. Furthermore, the
background estimation in CPPSPraat is based on Theil robust
fitting method, whereas the CPPSSpeechTool uses a plain linear
regression for that purpose. The latter method is therefore
more sensitive to outliers. Finally, some minor differences
are the choice of windowing function (ie, a Gaussian
window in the CPPSPraat algorithm and a Hamming window
in the CPPSSpeechTool application), a parabolic interpolation
to find the peak value in Praat and a sampling frequency
independent preemphasis in Praat.42
Acoustic voice quality index: alfa version versus beta
version
Based on the data of these acoustic markers, two versions of the
AVQI were calculated. In the first version—ie, the original or
alfa version, as developed by Maryn et al4—the AVQI
was determined according to the following formula:
AVQIalfa¼8.471"0.2853CPPSSpeechTool"0.1883HNR"0.548
3 SL + 7.171 3 SLdB " 0.082 3 Slope " 0.198 3 Tilt. So, the
AVQIalfa is a combination of five acoustic markers in the program
Praat plus one acoustic marker in the program SpeechTool. However, having to combine two computer programs to come to one
single index of dysphonia severity decreased the userfriendliness/feasibility of the AVQIalfa and induced a relatively laborious
procedure with at least eight steps.
To maximize its feasibility and to lower the number of processing
steps and commands required from the clinician, a second or beta
version of the AVQI was developed. Instead of inserting SpeechTool’s CPPS data in the AVQIalfa formula, Praat’s recently introduced CPPS data were inserted. Stepwise multiple linear
regression analysis and linear rescaling of the outcomes of the equation to scores between 0 and 10 resulted in the following formula:
AVQIbeta ¼ 9.072 " 0.245 3 CPPSPraat " 0.161 3 HNR " 0.470 3
SL + 6.158 3 SLdB " 0.071 3 Slope " 0.170 3 Tilt.
With this beta version, only the program Praat is involved
and the number of commands is minimized to only two: (1)
making the necessary recordings, and (2) activating the
recently customized Praat script that automatically yields
an AVQIbeta score. The different parts and settings/parameters of this script can be consulted in Appendix, and exam-

ples of the output of this Praat script (ie, the relevant data
and graphs) in a subject with a normal voice and a subject
with a pathological voice are shown in Figures 1 and 2,
respectively.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses in the present study were completed using SPSS for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). To answer the first question of the present study, the proportional relationship between CPPSSpeechTool and CPPSPraat
was investigated with the parametric Pearson productmoment correlation coefficient (ie, rP). The variance in
CPPSSpeechTool that is accounted for by the variance in CPPSPraat
was investigated with the coefficient of determination (ie, rP2).
Similarly, to respond to the second research question, the degree of correspondence between AVQIalfa and AVQIbeta was
examined with rP and their shared variance with rP2.
RESULTS
Correspondence between CPPSSpeechTool and
CPPSPraat
The descriptive statistics in Table 2 show that the CPPSPraat data
are systematically higher than the CPPSSpeechTool data because of
the dissimilarities in signal processing between the two measures. However, the scatterplot in Figure 3 illustrates the proportional association between the CPPSSpeechTool and CPPSPraat data
and represents a quasi-perfect correlation of rP ¼ 0.961
(P < 0.0001, df ¼ 287). With rP2 ¼ 0.924, this means that
92.4% of the variance in CPPSSpeechTool is accounted for by
the variance in CPPSPraat.
Correspondence between AVQIalfa and AVQIbeta
The descriptive data in Table 2 highlight that the AVQIbetavalues very much resemble the AVQIalfa-values. The proportional relationship between the AVQIalfa and the AVQIbeta is
clarified by the scatterplot in Figure 4. Based on the
rP ¼ 0.980 (P < 0.0001, df ¼ 287) between these data and the
corresponding rP2 ¼ 0.960, it can be stated that the AVQIbeta
almost perfectly (ie, for 96.0%) represents the AVQIalfa.
DISCUSSION
The present study investigated the interconnection between versions of two modern methods to objectively-acoustically assess
general dysphonia severity: CPPS and AVQI. The CPPS is
determined in the smoothed power cepstrum by the difference
in amplitude between the peak of first rahmonic and the corresponding value on the fit line exactly below the peak. This
measure merits special attention as a tool in the clinical measurement of overall voice quality. It was introduced in the field
of voice pathology by Hillenbrand et al27 and Hillenbrand and
Houde,28 and although initially intended to estimate the degree
of breathiness in sustained vowels and continuous speech,
respectively, it also surfaced to be a valid and reliable measure
of overall dysphonia severity.24 The AVQI4 is a multivariate,
accessible/feasible, and reasonably valid method to clinically
measure overall dysphonia severity in chained recordings of
both a sustained vowel and continuous speech.

with window length ¼ 0.03 s, time step ¼ 0.002 s, and frequency step ¼ 20 Hz. This spectrogram clearly shows harmonic structures from the bottom
up to at least 4000 Hz in the continuous speech and the sustained vowel. There is neither subharmonic nor interharmonic noise, resulting in relatively
low shimmer. Center right graph: long-term average spectrum with frequency step ¼ 1 Hz. This spectrum shows a relatively unsteep inclination of
the spectral energy (ie, less negative slope and tilt) and on average 21 harmonics emerge in the concatenated sound, resulting in an increased HNR.
Bottom left and right graphs: respectively power cepstrogram and power cepstrum with time step ¼ 0.02 s and ranging between 0.00303 s and
0.01667 s (ie, 330 Hz and 60 Hz, respectively). Both the power cepstrogram and the power cepstrum show clear emergence of a sharp first rahmonic,
leading to increased CPPS.
Because the originally published AVQI-method combines two
computer programs (ie, Praat for the acoustic measures HNR,
SL, SLdB, Slope, and Tilt, and SpeechTool for the acoustic measure CPPS), it is considered relatively labor-intensive in terms of
number of computer actions and therefore relatively timeconsuming. To overcome this barrier (ie, to enable a singleprogram strategy) and to increase feasibility, a second version
of the AVQI had to be developed in which the program Speech-

Tool no longer needed to be combined with the program Praat
to yield all six acoustic measures of the AVQI model. Because
all six acoustic measures of the AVQI are available now in Praat
a simplification of the AVQI protocol became possible. However,
the recently implemented calculation of the CPPS in Praat42 deviates somewhat from the original calculation of the CPPS in
SpeechTool,27,28 precipitating the following two research
questions. First, is there an acceptable correlation/

triplophonia or f0/3-phonation. The noise and the subharmonics result in increased shimmer. Center right graph: long-term average spectrum with
frequency step ¼ 1 Hz. This spectrum shows a steep inclination of the spectral energy (ie, more negative slope and tilt) and on average only six
harmonics emerge in the concatenated sound, resulting in a decreased HNR. Bottom left and right graphs: respectively power cepstrogram and power
cepstrum with time step ¼ 0.02 s and ranging between 0.00303 s and 0.01667 s (ie, 330 Hz and 60 Hz, respectively). Both the power cepstrogram and
the power cepstrum show insufficient emergence and broadening of the first rahmonic, leading to decreased CPPS.

correspondence between the two versions of the CPPS? Second,
is there an acceptable interconnection between the two versions
of the AVQI? Based on analyses of clinical recordings of a
sustained [a:] and continuous speech provided by 28
normophonic and 261 dysphonic subjects, the present study
can give a positive answer to both questions. Up to 92.4%
of the variance in the original CPPSSpeechTool is explained

by the variance in the derived CPPSPraat. This indicates that
the CPPSPraat is a highly acceptable approximation of the
CPPSSpeechTool. Furthermore, the variance of the AVQIbeta
accounted for 96.0% the variance of the AVQIalfa. This means
that there is an almost perfect correspondence between the first
and the second version of the AVQI. It can thus be concluded
that it is very reasonable to apply the beta version of the AVQI

Caveats and limitatons
Although Praat is freeware, runs on most of the popular computer operating platforms, and is therefore open to most of
the voice clinicians, caution is required regarding the data
acquisition system in which it is applied. Many aspects related
to digital data acquisition and sound recording are known to
affect the outcome of algorithms for the acoustic measurement
of voice quality and their influence may not be underestimated.
First, external/environmental noise (ie, all sounds and signals
that are not meant to be recorded and analyzed during the clinical voice assessment) such as ventilation/fan noise of the computer, turbulence due to air conditioning, sounds outside the
recording room (eg, traffic, heavy wind, and so on.), mobile
phone interference, and so on may add erroneous signals to
the direct voice/speech signal before it is captured by the microphone.43 It is therefore crucial to minimize noise and to strive
for a recording environment with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (ie, SNR). Studies of Deliyski et al44,45 show that an
SNR ¼ 30 dB is the minimum for voice measures to be valid
and reliable, and that a SNR ¼ 42 dB is required to obtain
99% accuracy in acoustic voice quality measures. This can be

achieved in an anechoic chamber, a special sound treated
room, or another room that is known to have sufficiently low
noise levels. For the voice to be recorded reliably at eg,
70 dB on average, the voice clinician is advised to avoid
interference so the noise does not exceed 40 dB. Second,
microphone type and placement may also influence the sound
recordings. In general, the following recommendations can
lead the choice of a microphone46–48: a head-mounted
condenser microphone with an XLR connection, a low impedance, a cardioid directionality pattern, a frequency response
curve that is flat (ie, within 2 dB variation) between circa 50–
8000 Hz, and a dynamic measuring range between circa 40–
130 dB without distortion of the voice signal. Additionally,
such a microphone should be placed off-axis (ie, at 45$ or
90$ from the direct air stream from the mouth) at approximately
5–10 cm from the mouth.49 Third, it is generally advised to
build-in an external mixer soundcard between the microphone
and the computer,47 and to make sure that the technical characteristics are similar to those of the microphone in terms of dynamic range, frequency response, and so on.48 Fourth, aspects
related to analog-to-digital conversion are also important and
it is advised to record the voice sounds with a sampling frequency of at least 26 kHz50 and a resolution of at least
24 bits.48 Many studies have examined the effects of these

digital sound recording-related items on voice perturbation
measures (ie, jitter, shimmer, and/or HNR) and found significant results. To our knowledge, however, the impact of microphone type and placement, environmental acoustics,
digitization characteristics, and so forth on the power cepstrum,
the prominence of the cepstral peak, and the outcome of the
AVQI have not been investigated before. Therefore, to promote
standardized and reliable methods for CPPS, AVQI, and other
measures, future research should explore the influence of
recording-related variables on the outcome of these measures.
Meanwhile voice clinicians are advised to use the highest quality recording equipment in an environment with sufficient SNR.

## 1. roubeau2009

**Full reference:**
Roubeau B, Henrich N, Castellengo M. Laryngeal vibratory mechanisms: the notion of vocal register revisited. *J Voice*. 2009;23(4):425-438. doi:10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.10.014

**PDF verified at:** `paper/articles/Roubeau_JVoice_2009 (1).pdf`

**Source passage from PDF (page 1):**
> "The pitches of transitions between the two main mechanisms M1 and M2 and the range of the frequency-overlap region are described in detail."

**Source passage from PDF (showing 312 Hz Eb4 transition):**
> "312 Hz—Eb4" (Table 2, frequency jump during M1-M2 transition)

**Occurrences in article (5):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 82) — Introduction
> "...a rigorous interdisciplinary science at the intersection of laryngeal physiology, acoustics, ethnomusicology, and signal engineering."

**Claim supported:** The study of singing voice has become an interdisciplinary science integrating physiology, acoustics, and signal processing.
**Assessment:** General claim. Roubeau et al. (2009) is a foundational paper on laryngeal mechanisms that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of modern vocal science (physiology + acoustics + signal analysis). Appropriate citation. Note: the paper's scope is specifically about laryngeal vibratory mechanisms and vocal registers, not a broad review of the field — but it exemplifies the interdisciplinary approach. *Verified from PDF: confirms interdisciplinary methodology combining EGG, acoustics, and physiology.*

### Occurrence 2 (line 200) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "The scientific response to this classification gap lies in the theory of laryngeal vibration mechanisms, established by Roubeau, Henrich, and Castellengo."

**Claim supported:** Attribution of the M0-M3 laryngeal mechanism framework to these authors.
**Assessment:** Correct. This is the seminal paper establishing the four-mechanism framework (M0-M3) based on physiological measurements. Well-established attribution in the field.

### Occurrence 3 (line 219) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "M2 produces lower overall amplitude, energy concentrated in high harmonics, and characteristic phase transitions at register boundaries."

**Claim supported:** Acoustic characteristics of M2 (lower amplitude, energy in high harmonics, phase transitions).
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously cited as henrich2014 (male operatic singers, vocal tract resonances — wrong topic). Now correctly cites roubeau2009, which covers both sexes and directly describes M2 acoustic properties as part of the mechanism framework.

### Occurrence 4 (line 227) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "The choice within this zone is determined not solely by fundamental frequency (f₀) but by desired intensity and timbre."

**Claim supported:** In the M1/M2 overlap zone, mechanism selection depends on intensity and timbre, not just f₀.
**Assessment:** Consistent with the paper's findings about the overlap zone between mechanisms.

### Occurrence 5 (line 527) — Results §4.2
> "...confirming the physiological basis of the G4 passaggio boundary for female voices documented in the literature."

**Claim supported:** The ~400 Hz (G4) boundary for the female voice passaggio is documented in the literature.
**Assessment:** Roubeau et al. (2009) documents frequency ranges for mechanism transitions. The specific ~400 Hz boundary for female voices can be inferred from their data on M1/M2 transition frequencies. **SOURCE PASSAGE CONFIRMED:** PDF shows "312 Hz—Eb4" for female M1→M2 transition, with overlap zone spanning roughly one octave. 400 Hz lies in the upper portion of this overlap zone. Article text has been rewritten: "lies in the upper portion of the passaggio region rather than at a discrete boundary."

## 2. henrich2006

**Full reference:**
Henrich N. Mirroring the voice from Garcia to the present day: some insights into singing voice registers. *Logoped Phoniatr Vocol*. 2006;31(1):3-14. doi:10.1080/14015430500344844

**PDF verified at:** `paper/articles/henrich2006.pdf`

**Occurrence in article (1):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 82) — Introduction
> "...a rigorous interdisciplinary science at the intersection of laryngeal physiology, acoustics, ethnomusicology, and signal engineering."

**Claim supported:** Same general claim as roubeau2009 above — vocal science as interdisciplinary.
**Assessment:** Henrich (2006) is a review paper tracing the history of vocal register research from Manuel Garcia to modern methods. Appropriate as a historical overview citation. Note: paper focuses on singing voice registers specifically, not the full breadth of vocal science.

## 3. cotton2007

**Full reference:**
Cotton S. Voice Classification and Fach: Usage and Inconsistencies. DMA thesis, University of North Carolina at Greensboro; 2007.

**PDF verified at:** `paper/articles/cotton2007.pdf`

**Source passage from PDF (page 9):**
> "The disagreements concerning voice classification lie in the criteria for determining classification, as well as the extent to which classification should affect training and repertoire choices."

**Source passage from PDF (page 3):**
> "The language used in the singing community to talk about singing is imprecise if and when those who use it fail to thoroughly define and explain it."

**Occurrences in article (2):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 89) — Introduction
> "...the classification of singing voices in Western pedagogy remains dominated by the German Fach system, a taxonomic framework developed in the 19th century for European opera."

**Claim supported:** The Fach system dominates Western vocal classification and originates from 19th-century European opera.
**Assessment:** Cotton's DMA dissertation specifically examines Fach classification and its inconsistencies. Appropriate citation for the claim about the system's dominance and origins.

### Occurrence 2 (line 187) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "Cotton's doctoral research documented systematic inconsistencies in Fach assignment among professional voice teachers, demonstrating that even within its native operatic context, the system lacks reliability and inter-rater agreement."

**Claim supported:** Professional voice teachers show inconsistencies and low inter-rater agreement in Fach assignment.
**Assessment:** This is the central finding of Cotton's dissertation. **SOURCE PASSAGE CONFIRMED:** PDF shows discussions of "disagreements" and "imprecise language" among pedagogues. The thesis is qualitative, not a formal reliability study, but documents disagreements among voice teachers. Article text has been softened to: "voice classification criteria remain contested among pedagogues and lack standardized application."

## 4. miller2000

**Full reference:**
Miller R. *Training Soprano Voices*. New York: Oxford University Press; 2000.

**Occurrence in article (1):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 89) — Introduction
> "...the classification of singing voices in Western pedagogy remains dominated by the German Fach system, a taxonomic framework developed in the 19th century for European opera."

**Claim supported:** Same claim about Fach system dominance.
**Assessment:** Miller is a canonical reference in operatic vocal pedagogy. His books discuss Fach classification extensively. Appropriate supporting citation.

## 5. tatit2002

**Full reference:**
Tatit L. *O Cancionista: composição de canções no Brasil*. São Paulo: EDUSP; 2002.

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 99-101) — Introduction
> "...what Tatit terms *figurativização* — the speech-like quality of Brazilian popular singing that privileges natural articulation over resonant projection."

**Claim supported:** Attribution of the concept of *figurativização* in Brazilian popular singing to Tatit.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously used invented English terms ("colloquial expressivity"). Now uses Tatit's actual term *figurativização* (p. 21, *O Cancionista*), which describes the speech-like quality of Brazilian popular singing — the tension between *fala* (speech) and *canto* (singing). Verified by author against original source.

### Occurrence 2 (line 677-678) — Results §4.5
> "This finding is consistent with Tatit's characterization of Brazilian popular singing as prioritizing *figurativização* — the primacy of speech-like intonation in Brazilian popular song."

**Claim supported:** Brazilian popular singing prioritizes speech-like qualities.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously used "singability of speech." Now uses the correct Portuguese term *figurativização* with an accurate gloss. Verified by author.

### Occurrence 3 (line 717-718) — Discussion §5.1
> "This finding supports Tatit's concept of *figurativização*: the singer prioritizes natural language articulation..."

**Claim supported:** Same concept of speech-like singing quality.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously used "colloquial expressivity." Now consistently uses *figurativização*.

## 6. rezende2016

**Full reference:**
Rezende, Daniela. *A voz e o choro: aspectos técnicos vocais e o repertório de choro cantado como ferramenta de estudo no canto popular*. Olinda: Livro Rápido; 2016. ISBN 978-85-5707-133-9.

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 101) — Introduction
> "...rapid ornamental passages (glissandi, portamenti), precise diction at high speed, rhythmic agility..."

**Claim supported:** Choro singing demands specific vocal competencies including ornamentation, diction, and rhythmic agility.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously cited as ferraz2010 (wrong author name, wrong year, wrong publication type). The correct source is Rezende (2016), a published book (not a master's thesis) by Daniela Rezende, verified from the book's *ficha catalográfica*. The book specifically covers vocal technique in Choro singing.

### Occurrence 2 (line 109-111) — Introduction
> "The essential vocal competencies of Choro — vocal attack precision, articulatory diction at high speed, ornamental agility, register management, resonance adjustments, and controlled vibrato..."

**Claim supported:** Specific list of Choro vocal competencies.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Both the citation (ferraz2010 → rezende2016) and the competency list were updated. The original list ("respiratory control, diction clarity, sustenance, ornamental agility, precise intonation, effective vocal emission") was replaced with competencies verified from Rezende's book content: vocal attack precision, articulatory diction at high speed, ornamental agility, register management, resonance adjustments, and controlled vibrato. Verified by author against the book.

### Occurrence 3 (line 180) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "Forcing Choro singers into Fach categories leads to reductive 'pigeonholing' that ignores individual 'comfort tessitura' — the range within which a singer achieves optimal articulatory agility and textual intelligibility."

**Claim supported:** The concept of "comfort tessitura" as central to Choro vocal technique.
**Assessment:** Rezende's book discusses vocal technique requirements that imply this concept. The term "comfort tessitura" is the author's interpretive framing of Rezende's practical discussion.

## 7. boratto2025

**Full reference:**
Boratto T, Costa GdO, Meireles A, Alves AKSTR, Saporetti CM, Bodini M, Cury A, Goliatt L. Machine learning with evolutionary parameter tuning for singing registers classification. *Signals*. 2025;6(1):9. doi:10.3390/signals6010009

**PDF verified at:** `paper/articles/signals-06-00009.pdf`

**Source passage from PDF:**
> "The obtained findings demonstrated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting model, optimized with DE, achieved an average classification accuracy of 97.60%, thus indicating the efficacy of the proposed approach for singing-voice register classification."

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 116) — Introduction
> "XGBoost algorithms optimized by Differential Evolution have achieved vocal register classification accuracy exceeding 97% in controlled settings."

**Claim supported:** XGBoost with evolutionary optimization achieves >97% accuracy in vocal register classification.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously attributed to "Almeida J, et al." — **no author named Almeida exists in this paper**. Real authors: Boratto et al. (8 authors, UFJF/UERJ/UniMi). Claims verified from PDF: XGBoost + DE → 97.60% accuracy (confirmed). Dataset: 350 audio files of a single experienced singer singing the vowel "a" for 6 seconds in 3 registers (chest, mixed, head) in a controlled studio setting. NOT songs, NOT pop music.

### Occurrence 2 (line 137) — Introduction
> "...controlled singing experiments..."

**Claim supported:** ML has been applied to singing register classification in controlled experiments.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously grouped with almeida2025a under "Western pop music" — this was wrong. Boratto et al. is about controlled vowel recordings, not pop music. Text now correctly describes it as "controlled singing experiments."

### Occurrence 3 (line 880) — Conclusion
> "...the evolutionary parameter tuning approach demonstrated by Boratto et al."

**Claim supported:** Reference to evolutionary parameter tuning for potential VMI weight optimization.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously said "Almeida et al." — now correctly attributes to Boratto

CONCLUSION
It is possible to reduce the confusion that still exists in the domain of vocal registers, only if one defines with precision the
mode and nature of observation of vocal productions. This is
the approach we have adopted here at the laryngeal level,
with populations of singers and nonsingers, men and women.
Macroscopic and microscopic analyses of the EGG signal recorded at the laryngeal vibrator level were made. This approach
has allowed us to demonstrate, in accordance with some of the
literature, the existence of four distinct laryngeal vibratory
mechanisms, identified by the analysis of transitions. These
four laryngeal mechanisms, graded from low to high, from
zero to three, ensure the production of the whole vocal range,
for men’s and women’s voices, be they singers or nonsingers.
On the macroscopic level, the abrupt modifications in amplitude of the EGG signal characterize the change of mechanism,
whereas on the microscopic level, mechanisms are identified
thanks to the study of the signal derivative and to the analysis
of the open quotient. The changes in aspect of the EGG signal
are directly linked to the changes in mechanical configuration
of the laryngeal vibrator.
The ranges produced by the different mechanisms are not
contiguous but overlap each other, particularly in the case of
mechanisms M1 and M2. Based on this physiological notion
of laryngeal vibratory mechanism applicable to the whole of
the human population, it is easy to understand that the parameters such as the production type (spoken or sung), the gender,
and cultural context will guide the exclusive or privileged use
of one mechanism rather than another.
As for the sung voice, it is mainly the esthetic context that directs the choice of one or other mechanisms used, developing
homogeneity or on the contrary contrasts of vocal timbre
when several mechanisms are involved.
In their vocal practice, singers are accustomed to distinguishing sound categories regrouped under the name of register,
based on the acoustic qualities or the proprioceptive sensations

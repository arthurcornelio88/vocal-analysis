Conclusion
Since Garcia, knowledge about singing voice registers has evolved, thanks to the development of new
experimental techniques. Yet, the controversy about
vocal registers, which already existed in Garcia’s
time, is still present nowadays, and reflected in the
multiplicity of labels for registers. It seems to have its
roots in the definition of a register and its defining
characteristics. If a vocal register is defined as a series
of consecutive tones produced by the same laryngeal
mechanism, the human voice can be characterized
by four different voice registers, i.e., laryngeal
registers such as Hollien’s pulse , modal, loft registers,
and the whistle register. If a vocal register is defined
as series of consecutive tones produced with similar
voice quality, other registers exist in the human
singing voice, such as head, belting , middle, upper,
voix mixte ,. . . One major issue is then to define a
vocal register precisely before labelling it. Another
major issue is to be precise about the means which
are required to identify a given vocal register. The
identification of vocal registers can benefit from
the detection of transition phenomena. In this way,
the concept of laryngeal mechanism, which is based
on the detection of laryngeal transition phenomena
by means of electroglottography, is of great help in
clarifying the laryngeal nature of a given voice
production. At least, the singing voice registers can
now be described in terms of the laryngeal mechanism by which they are produced. Further research is
needed to understand the singers’ resonance strategies and acoustic adaptations which are required to
produce a specific voice quality or to successfully

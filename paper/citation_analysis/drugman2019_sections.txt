signals were available. Our first conclusion is that the usefulness of NAQ,
H1-H2 and HRF for parameterizing the glottal flow is confirmed. We also
confirmed other works in the literature (such as (Alku et al., 2002) and
(Alku et al., 2009)) showing that these parameters can be effectively used as
measures for discriminating different voice qualities. Our results show that
the effectiveness of CPIF and CCD appears to be similar and rather high,
with a slight preference towards CCD. However, it should be emphasized here
that in our real speech tests, clean signals recorded for text-to-speech (TTS)
synthesis were used. We can thus confirm the effectiveness of CCD for TTS
applications (such as emotional/expressive TTS). However, for applications
which require the analysis of noisy signals (such as telephone applications)
further testing is needed. We observed that in the synthetic speech tests, the
ranking dramatically changed depending on the SNR and the robustness of
CCD was observed to be rather low. IAIF has lower performance in most tests
(both in synthetic and real speech tests) but shows up to be comparatively
more effective in very low SNR values.

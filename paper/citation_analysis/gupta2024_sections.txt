screen the title and abstract of all the articles. The first
author will screen all the articles and the rest of the
screening work will be divided among the other authors.
Screening conflicts will be resolved via group discussion
among authors.
The articles selected for full-­text review will similarly be
assessed by two authors. Again, the first author will review
all of the articles with the remaining work to be divided
among the other authors. Conflicts will again be resolved
via group discussion.
The results of the search and inclusion process will be
presented using a PRISMA-­ScR flow diagram.55

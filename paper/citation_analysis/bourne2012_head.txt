Three Music Theater vocal qualities (“chesty belt,” “twangy belt,” and “legit”) were investigated in
female singers at their overlap range, between F#4-D5 (370-600 Hz). Six experienced Music
Theater singers performed each quality on two different vowels ([e], [O]). Audio and electroglottographic (EGG) signals were recorded as well as the vocal tract impedance. In chesty belt and
twangy belt, singers systematically tuned the frequency of their first vocal tract resonance (R1) to
the second harmonic (2f0) up to C5. R1 remained lower in frequency for the legit quality. No tuning
of the second vocal tract resonance (R2) was observed in any of these qualities although R2
frequency was significantly higher in both belt qualities than in legit. Closed quotient, degree of
symmetry of the EGG waveform, sound pressure level (SPL) and the energy of the spectrum above
1 kHz were significantly greater in chesty belt than in legit but not significantly different between
chesty belt and twangy belt qualities. A fourth quality (“mix”) was explored in three singers. Different production strategies were observed for each singer, with values of spectral, glottal and vocal
tract descriptors found in between those measured for legit and chesty belt qualities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Female professional Music Theater singers are expected
to master the vocal qualities: belt, legit, and mix. These
terms are commonly used by expert teachers (Bourne and
Kenny, 2008; Bourne et al., 2010) and within the Music Theater profession, although they are not yet well defined from a
physiological and acoustic point of view. This study aims to
provide objective measurements to characterize and compare
the laryngeal behavior, the vocal tract adjustment and spectral features of these Music Theater qualities.
Most research on the acoustics of the singing voice has
focused on classical and operatic singing. However, there have
been some recent studies of nonclassical styles (country, pop,
Broadway, Music Theater, R&B, jazz, rock, and blues),
increasingly referred to as contemporary commercial music
(CCM) vocal styles (Lovetri, 2008). CCM singing styles can be
distinguished from classical singing by the regular use of
amplification, a greater emphasis on lyrics and textual comprehension by the audience, and frequent employment of the voice
quality described as “belt” (Lovetri, 2002; AATS, 2008).
Perceptually, belt has been described as a projected
sound with “brightness,” “ring,” and “forward,” speech-like
vowels (Stanley, 1929; Osborne, 1979; Estill, 1980; Edwin,
2004; AATS, 2008; LeBorgne et al., 2010) in contrast to the
“covered” sound and “back” vowels of the classical voice.

However, the genre of CCM is broad, and the term belt
actually relates to a range of different sounds (Lovetri, 2002;
Popeil, 2007). In fact, there is considerable disagreement
among CCM experts about the distinctive features of belt,
some arguing that belt is not always loud (Edwin, 2002;
Popeil, 2007; LeBorgne et al., 2010), that belt has no vibrato
(Estill, 1980; Miles and Hollien, 1990), or that the degree of
vibrato may be a stylistic choice (Bourne and Kenny, 2008;
LeBorgne et al., 2010), that belt is intrinsically a nasal quality (Miles and Hollien, 1990) or not (Bourne and Kenny,
2008; LeBorgne et al., 2010).
Acoustically, the belt quality has shown increased
energy in the high frequencies of the spectrum (Bestebreurtje
and Schutte, 2000; McCoy, 2007) and higher first formant
frequencies (F1) compared to classical singing (Sundberg
et al., 1993). Proximity between F1 and the second voice
harmonic (2f0) has been reported on [a] and [O] vowels in a
female Music Theater singer (Schutte and Miller, 1993),
suggesting that belters may tune the first vocal tract resonance (R1)1 to the second voice harmonic (2f0). Such tuning
has been observed over the same range in Bulgarian singing
(Henrich et al., 2007), a musical style that shares some similarities in timbre with the female belt sound.
Physiologically, the belt quality has been characterized
by higher values of the laryngeal closed quotient and higher
levels of subglottal pressure than for classical singing (Estill,
1980; Sundberg et al., 1993; Bjorkner et al., 2006; Barlow
and Lovetri, 2010), supporting the argument by some singing
teachers that female belt is produced by raising the transition
pitch from ‘chest register” to “head register” by up to an
octave (Schutte and Miller, 1993; Bestebreurtje and Schutte,

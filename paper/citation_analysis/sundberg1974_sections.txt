CONCLUSIONS

The acoustically most essential articulatory difference
between maie speech and singing appears to be the wid-

ening of the pharynx at the level of the larynx tube opening. Such a widening of the pharynx seems to be accompanying a lowering of the larynx. Acoustically, the
pharynx widening has the effect of isolating the larynx

of the vocal

tract

so that its reso-

nance frequency is not altered by articulatory movements

ABSTRACT Formant tracking is investigated in this study by using trackers based on dynamic programming (DP) and deep neural nets (DNNs). Using the DP approach, six formant estimation methods were
first compared. The six methods include linear prediction (LP) algorithms, weighted LP algorithms and
the recently developed quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) method. QCP-FB gave the best
performance in the comparison. Therefore, a novel formant tracking approach, which combines benefits
of deep learning and signal processing based on QCP-FB, was proposed. In this approach, the formants
predicted by a DNN-based tracker from a speech frame are refined using the peaks of the all-pole spectrum
computed by QCP-FB from the same frame. Results show that the proposed DNN-based tracker performed
better both in detection rate and estimation error for the lowest three formants compared to reference formant
trackers. Compared to the popular Wavesurfer, for example, the proposed tracker gave a reduction of 29%,
48% and 35% in the estimation error for the lowest three formants, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

of VTRs is an important and necessary computational block.

Estimation and tracking of formant frequencies is an important research topic in several areas of speech science
and technology [1]–[6]. During the past few decades, many
techniques have been proposed for formant tracking [7]–
[10]. These algorithms typically consist of two parts, the
estimation stage and the tracking stage. In the former, initial
estimates of the vocal tract resonances (VTRs) are computed
in short frames (e.g., 25 ms) using spectral estimation methods such as linear prediction (LP). In the latter, the formants estimated from individual frames are expressed using
contours which cover a longer unit (e.g., word or sentence)
[7], [8]. In addition, estimation and tracking can be done
simultaneously using an initial representation of the vocal
tract system [9], [10]. In both approaches, accurate estimation

LP is the most widely used technique to estimate VTRs
from speech [11] and therefore many variants of LP have
been proposed (e.g. [12], [13]). In formant estimation and
tracking, the most popular variants are the autocorrelation
and covariance methods [7], [8]. The closed phase (CP)
analysis is known to improve VTR estimates by avoiding
the contribution of the speech samples in the open phase of
the glottal cycle thereby decoupling the effect of the trachea
more effectively [14]. CP analysis, however, works better for
low-pitched voices which typically have a larger number of
samples in the closed phase of the glottal cycle compared
to high-pitched voices which might have just a few samples
in the closed phase. To reduce problems caused by having a
small number of closed phase samples, LP can be computed

Weighted linear prediction (WLP) is an all-pole modeling method based on temporally weighting the prediction
error [13], [15]–[20]. Temporal weighting of the prediction
error has been shown to be beneficial in computing vocal
tract models which are robust with respect to noise and the
selection of analysis window as well as the biasing effect
of high fundamental frequency. Formant estimation of highpitched vowels was studied using WLP in [18] by developing a simple weighting function, called the attenuated main
excitation (AME) function, to downgrade the strong effect
of the glottal source in the computation of the vocal tract
model. Based on [18], the quasi-closed phase (QCP) method
was proposed for glottal inverse filtering (GIF) in [19]. In
QCP, a more generalized AME-type of weighting function
is used. Recently, a new formant estimation method based
on QCP, called quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCPFB) LP analysis, was proposed in [21]. QCP-FB combines
two approaches: (1) QCP analysis in which the residual is
temporally weighted, and (2) forward-backward (FB) analysis in which the number of samples is increased in LP by
using two prediction directions simultaneously. In addition,
WLP methods have been proposed recently based on using
stochastic approaches in the computation of the weighting
function [22].
In this article, formant tracking is studied by investigating
different all-pole modeling methods in formant estimation.
The all-pole formant estimation methods are used with two
formant tracking approaches, a dynamic programming (DP)
-based approach and a deep neural net (DNN) -based approach. As the first part of the study, six different LP-based
and WLP-based formant estimation methods are compared
in formant tracking using a DP-based tracker. The novelty of
this part is in studying how the potential new method, QCPFB, which was investigated solely in formant estimation in

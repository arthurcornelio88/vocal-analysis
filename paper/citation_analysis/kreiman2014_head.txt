ABSTRACT: At present, two important questions about voice remain unanswered: When voice quality changes, what
physiological alteration caused this change, and if a change to the voice production system occurs, what change in
perceived quality can be expected? We argue that these questions can only be answered by an integrated model of
voice linking production and perception, and we describe steps towards the development of such a model. Preliminary
evidence in support of this approach is also presented. We conclude that development of such a model should be a
priority for scientists interested in voice, to explain what physical condition(s) might underlie a given voice quality,
or what voice quality might result from a specific physical configuration.

RESUMEN: Hacia una teoría unificada de la producción y la percepción de la voz.- En la actualidad quedan por
contestar dos cuestiones importantes relacionadas con la voz, a saber: (1) cuando la cualidad de la voz cambia, ¿qué
alteración en el mecanismo vocal es la responsable?; y (2) si se produce un cambio en el sistema de producción de la
voz, ¿qué cambio puede esperarse en la cualidad de voz percibida auditivamente? Sostenemos que la única respuesta
posible a estas preguntas reside en un modelo de voz integrado que una producción y percepción, y describimos pasos
hacia el desarrollo de tal modelo. Presentamos evidencias preliminares para respaldar esta propuesta. Concluimos que
el desarrollo de semejante modelo debería ser una prioridad para los científicos interesados en la voz con el fin de explicar
qué condición o condiciones físicas podrían subyacer a una cualidad de voz determinada, o qué cualidad de voz podría
derivar de una configuración física específica.
PALABRAS CLAVE: cualidad de voz; producción de voz; modelo; síntesis; acústica

1. INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS A UNIFIED
THEORY OF VOICE, AND WHY DO WE NEED
ONE?
In general, speakers phonate in order to convey information (linguistic or paralinguistic; intentionally or
unintentionally) to a listener. The stages of transmitting
information in this way can be described by the wellknown “speech chain” (Figure 1; Denes & Pinson,
1993). We presently know a good deal about the individual steps along the chain, including motor planning, la-

ryngeal innervation, tissue properties, the biomechanics
of laryngeal vibrations, aeroacoustics, acoustics and
resonance, and voice perception. However, very few
studies address the manner in which information is
transmitted from one stage to the next, much less from
one end of this chain to the other. As a result, two important questions about voice remain unanswered: 1)
When voice quality changes in some way, what caused
the change? and 2) If a change occurs in voice production, what will be the resulting perceived change in
quality? In this paper, we motivate a model of voice that

is designed to answer these questions, and describe our
preliminary steps towards generating this model.
In our view, these two questions define the primary
goals of the study of voice. Because voice production,
acoustics, and perception are all parts of the same communicative process, understanding the communicative
function of any of these aspects of voice—laryngeal/
physiologic, acoustic, or perceptual—requires knowledge of how each stage interacts with the others in the
transmission of vocal information. Details of voice
production, acoustics and quality may be misinterpreted
without considering the other domains. For example,
dozens of different measures of acoustic jitter, shimmer,
and harmonics-to-noise ratios (HNRs) have been proposed (see Buder, 2000, for review), presumably because
the authors assumed that jitter and shimmer were important vocal characteristics. Hundreds of research papers
have examined the correlations between ratings of voice
quality and these acoustic measures (see e.g. Maryn,
Roy, De Bodt, Van Cauwenberge, & Corthals, 2009,
for review), and many more examined correlations between measured perturbation and voice physiology or
vocal diagnosis (see e.g. Roy et al., 2013, for review).
However, acoustic perturbation measures are not individually informative about voice quality, because listeners cannot hear even large differences in jitter or shimmer (although they are sensitive to changes in the overall
level of harmonic vs. inharmonic energy in the voice
source; Kreiman & Gerratt, 2005). Further, jitter, shimmer, and noise tell us little about voice production, because they have multiple neurological, biomechanical,
aerodynamic, and acoustic causes (see Titze, 1994, for
review). Thus, these studies have not resulted in any
significant insight into voice production or perception,
because questions about causation are difficult to answer
without a model explicitly linking production to perception. In another example, clinicians applying stroboscopy
or high-speed video imaging often interpret asymmetric
vocal fold motion as evidence of vocal pathology.
However, although asymmetries sometimes co-occur
with abnormal voice qualities, asymmetrical vibration
can also occur without any negative effect on the sound
of the voice. High-speed video and audio recordings
demonstrating such an asymmetry in a normal speaker
are presented in the supplemental material [S1] accompanying this paper (see also Zhang, Kreiman, Gerratt,
& Garellek, 2013). Again, no theoretical model exists
to predict which asymmetries have perceptual consequences, and which do not.
Thus, apart from its basic science interest, a theory
describing the links between voice production and perception would also have substantial clinical importance,

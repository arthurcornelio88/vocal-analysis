Conclusion
We introduced a number of architectural changes to the Demucs architecture that greatly
improved the quality of source separation for music. On the MusDB HQ benchark, the gain is
around 1.4 dB. Those changes include compressed residual branches with local attention and
chunked biLSTM, and most importantly, a novel hybrid spectrogram/temporal domain U-Net
structure, with parallel temporal and spectrogram branches, that merge into a common core.
Those changes allowed to achieve the first rank at the 2021 Sony Music DemiXing challenge,
and translated into strong improvements of the overall quality and absence of bleeding between
sources as measured by human evaluations. For all its gain, one limitation of our approach is
the increased complexity of the U-Net encoder/decoder, requiring careful alignmement of the
temporal and spectral signals through well shaped convolutions.

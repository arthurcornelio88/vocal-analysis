This article presents the results of glottal open-quotient measurements in the case of singing voice
production. It explores the relationship between open quotient and laryngeal mechanisms, vocal
intensity, and fundamental frequency. The audio and electroglottographic signals of 18 classically
trained male and female singers were recorded and analyzed with regard to vocal intensity,
fundamental frequency, and open quotient. Fundamental frequency and open quotient are derived
from the differentiated electroglottographic signal, using the DECOM 共DEgg Correlation-based
Open quotient Measurement兲 method. As male and female phonation may differ in respect to
vocal-fold vibratory properties, a distinction is made between two different glottal configurations,
which are called laryngeal mechanisms: mechanism 1 共related to chest, modal, and male head
register兲 and mechanism 2 共related to falsetto for male and head register for female兲. The results
show that open quotient depends on the laryngeal mechanisms. It ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 in
mechanism 1 and from 0.5 to 0.95 in mechanism 2. The open quotient is strongly related to vocal
intensity in mechanism 1 and to fundamental frequency in mechanism 2. © 2005 Acoustical

I. INTRODUCTION

Voice quality is mainly due to the characteristics of
vocal-fold vibratory movement. Thus, a better understanding
of these properties would help to characterize voice quality.
In this context, the open quotient O q is a glottal source parameter of considerable interest, as it has been reported to be
related to voice qualities such as ‘‘breathy’’ and ‘‘pressed’’
共e.g., Alku and Vilkman, 1996; Klatt and Klatt, 1990兲. It is
defined as the ratio of the glottal open time over the fundamental period. It is a dimensionless parameter, ranging from
0 共no opening兲 to 1 共no or incomplete closure兲. This glottal
source parameter is the counterpart of the closed quotient
C q , given that O q ⫽1⫺C q . It can be measured directly by
the use of high-speed visualization 共Childers et al., 1990;

also been used, based on inverse filtering of volume velocity
or acoustic signals 共Holmberg et al., 1988, 1989, 1995; Sundberg et al., 1999a兲. It has also been related to the amplitude

Most of these studies showed a variation of open quotient with vocal intensity in speech and singing. A decrease
of open quotient with increase of vocal intensity was found
with high-speed visualization of one male speaker 共Timcke

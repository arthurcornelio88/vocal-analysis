In conclusion, the study showed that the two groups of formant estimation techniques that
have been used in formant trackers, the conventional model-based approach based on parametric
all-pole modeling and the modern data-driven approach, should not be seen as alternatives to each
other. Instead they can be used together to enhance the accuracy of data-driven trackers. Accuracy
improvement can be implemented easily by plugging an LP-based formant estimation method
into an existing data-driven tracker without re-training the tracker’s NNs. Future studies will be
conducted to analyze the system performance when the test data is taken from other annotated
databases than the VTR corpus, which was used in the training of DeepFormants.

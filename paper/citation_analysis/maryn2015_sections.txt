In conclusion, the AVQI is a multivariate, accessible,
feasible, and reasonably valid method to clinically measure
overall dysphonia severity in sustained vowel and continuous
speech samples. Because the CPPS was only available in the
program SpeechTool and not in the program Praat, the practical
disadvantage of the AVQI was that it required a protocol
combining both programs. This culminated in a relatively
high number of steps in the AVQI procedure: (1) recording
the continuous speech sample, (2) extracting and concatenating
the voiced segments with a customized script in Praat (ie, part
1), (3) recording the medial 3 seconds of [a:] (ie, part 2), (4)
chaining part 2 after part 1 in Praat, (5) determining CPPS in
SpeechTool, (6) determining harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR),
shimmer local (SL), SLdB, Slope, and Tilt with a customized
script in Praat, (7) completing the CPPS in a form in Praat,
and (8) calculating the AVQI with a customized script in Praat
(eg, Maryn et al40). The AVQI protocol was relatively laborious
on that account. However, because the recent implementation
of the cepstral peak prominence measures in Praat (since
version 5.3.53)–with various cepstral applications via the ‘‘To
PowerCepstrogram . ’’ function and the possibility to obtain
the cepstral metric via the ‘‘Get CPPS . ’’ command—it
became also possible to calculate the smoothed cepstral peak
prominence in this program. This new development in Praat
no longer necessitated a combination with SpeechTool, facilitating a single-program (ie, only in the program Praat) and
even a single-script (ie, instead of working with multiple scripts
as before, it became possible to merge all signal processing
steps into only one Praat-macro) solution for the AVQI, minimizing the manual labor for the voice clinician, and therefore
maximizing the AVQI’s feasibility. A new script (ie, a second
version or a beta version) for the AVQI was established to

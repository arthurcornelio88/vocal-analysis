Abstract: Behind human voice production, a complex biological mechanism generates
and modulates sound. Recent research has explored machine-learning (ML) techniques to
analyze singing-voice characteristics. However, the classification efficiency reported in such
research works suggests the possibility of improvement. In addition, there is also scope for
further improvement through the application of still under-utilized optimization techniques.
Thus, the present article proposes a novel approach that leverages the Differential Evolution
(DE) algorithm to optimize hyperparameters within three selected ML models, with the aim
of classifying singing-voice registers i.e., chest, mixed, and head registers). To develop the
present study, a dataset of 350 audio files encompassing the three aforementioned registers
was constructed. Then, the TSFEL Python library was employed to extract 14 pieces of
temporal information from the audio signals for subsequent classification by the employed
ML models. The obtained findings demonstrated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting
model, optimized with DE, achieved an average classification accuracy of 97.60%, thus
indicating the efficacy of the proposed approach for singing-voice register classification.

1. Introduction
Behind the apparent simplicity of the sound of the human voice lies an intricate interplay of resonances that both mold and define the unique quality of each voice. According
to [1], the human phonation system is made up of three parts: (I) the respiratory system,
(II) the pair of vocal folds, and (III) a system of cavities, i.e., the vocal tract. Since the
respiratory system performs the function of a compressor by compressing the air stored
in the lungs, only the last two mentioned parts contribute directly to the formation of the

vocal timbre. Indeed, the pair of vocal folds are responsible for generating sound through
vibrations that interrupt the airflow from the lungs in a sequence of air pulses.
The vocal tract includes the oral and nasal cavities, the pharynx, and the larynx,

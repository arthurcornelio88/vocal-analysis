V. CONCLUSIONS

Formant tracking was studied in this paper based on the
widely used two-stage approach consisting of the estimation
stage and the tracking stage. In the former, six different
all-pole modeling methods were first compared with a DPbased tracker. In addition, five known formant trackers were
used as references. Two most potential all-pole modeling
methods (LP-FBCOV and QCP-FBCOV) were then used
with a modern DNN-based tracker by proposing a novel
formant tracking technique which combines benefits of datadriven and model-driven approaches: the formants predicted
with the data-driven DNN were refined using the frequencies
of the peaks in the all-pole spectra computed by the modeldriven LP-FBCOV and QCP-FBCOV methods.
The DNN-based formant trackers using the LP-FBCOV
and QCP-FBCOV refinement were further compared to two
conventional formant trackers (Wavesurfer and KARMA)
and to one recently published DNN-based tracker (Deep
Formants). With the QCP-FBCOV refinement, the DNNbased tracker outperformed the conventional reference formant trackers in all metrics. Compared to Deep Formants,
the proposed DNN-tracker gave better performance in all
other metrics except for FDR and FEE in F3 where Deep
Formants was just slightly better. In addition to these encouraging objective results, it is worth emphasising that the
proposed QCP-FBCOV refinement technique can be used in
principle to improve the performance of any existing DNN6

based formant tracker which has been trained to map a speech
signal frame into formants, that is, there is no need to re-train
the DNN-based tracker used. However, it should be noted that
the performance of the proposed method might depend on
the accuracy of the estimated glottal closure instants, which
are needed to generate the QCP weighting function [19].
Therefore, the robustness of the proposed method in various

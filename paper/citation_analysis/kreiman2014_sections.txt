6. CONCLUSIONS, FUTURE WORK, AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE
The studies reviewed in this paper suggest that
phonation is best viewed as part of a communicative
process, the pieces of which are difficult to understand
out of the context of the entire process. Thus, understanding and ultimately predicting how speakers produce the
intended voice quality (and how disorders disturb this
process) requires a unified model of voice that links
production to perception.

Many issues await resolution as we work towards
this goal. Because phonation takes place in the time
domain while perception depends largely on spectral
information, understanding the relationship between
perception and production requires mapping between
time and spectral domain representations, which has
proven difficult (e.g., Fant, 1995; Ni Chasaide & Gobl,
1997). More than one physical configuration may produce the same voice quality; conversely, large changes
in configuration may not result in changes in quality.
Variables in the current voice source model certainly
interact: for example, we know that the perceptual

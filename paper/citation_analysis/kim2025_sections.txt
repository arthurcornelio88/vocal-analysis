Conclusion

3. Investigation of the intractability of the
model, particularly for the SVM, to
understand which spectral features are
most important for register classification.

In this paper, we have presented two machine learning approaches to vocal register classification that show great promise,
achieving high accuracy while maintaining
good generalization. The SVM has shown
itself to be the preferred analysis option at
the present moment, but the strengths of
CNNs provide a solid foundation for this
task, and show promise of a more robust
tool that could be leveraged across a greater
variety of vocal music. Additionally, we
briefly discussed the potential for real-world
applications and the development of AVRA
for analysis of male pop music, and how this
methodology could impact vocal pedagogy
and music production, providing tools for
both learning and creative applications in
the realm of vocal performance.

4. Comparison with other machine learning architectures, such as recurrent
neural network or transformer variants,
which might better capture temporal
dependencies in the audio signal.
5. Continued refinement of the AVRA application for singers and vocal coaches,
leveraging its practical advantages.

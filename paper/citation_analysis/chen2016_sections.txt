CONCLUSION

In this paper, we described the lessons we learnt when
building XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system that is
widely used by data scientists and provides state-of-the-art
results on many problems. We proposed a novel sparsity
aware algorithm for handling sparse data and a theoretically
justified weighted quantile sketch for approximate learning.
Our experience shows that cache access patterns, data compression and sharding are essential elements for building a
scalable end-to-end system for tree boosting. These lessons
can be applied to other machine learning systems as well.
By combining these insights, XGBoost is able to solve realworld scale problems using a minimal amount of resources.

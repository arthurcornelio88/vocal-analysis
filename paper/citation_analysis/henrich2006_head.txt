Mirroring the voice from Garcia to the present day: Some insights
into singing voice registers

Abstract
Starting from Garcia’s definition, the historical evolution of the notion of vocal registers from then until now is considered.
Even though much research has been carried out on vocal registers since then, the notion of registers is still confused in the
singing voice community, and defined in many different ways. While some authors consider a vocal register as a totally
laryngeal event, others define it in terms of overall voice quality similarities. This confusion is reflected in the multiplicity of
labellings, and it lies in the difficulty of identifying and specifying the mechanisms distinguished by these terms. The concept
of laryngeal mechanism is then introduced, on the basis of laryngeal transition phenomena detected by means of
electroglottography. It helps to specify at least the laryngeal nature of a given singing voice register. On this basis, the main
physiological, acoustic, and perceptual characteristics of the most common singing voice registers are surveyed.

Key words: Laryngeal mechanism, singing voice, vocal register

Introduction
Before the nineteenth century, knowledge about
human phonation was limited to what could be
perceived by auditory perception and proprioceptive
sensations, or observed from outside during phonation and inside on cadavers. The singing voice
registers are a known fact, related to perception of
different voice qualities. In this context, the singing
voice teacher Manuel Garcia II (1805 /1906) shows
not only an interest in the voice sound quality but
also in the underlying vocal physiology mechanisms.
On November 16th, 1840, he presented the results
of his observations as a voice teacher and his
experiments on the human voice to the French
Académie des Sciences (1), prior to the publication
of his famous singing voice method Ecole de Garcia:
Traité complet de l’art du chant (2). In this paper, he
claims that the human voice is composed of different
registers: poitrine (chest), fausset-tête (falsetto-head),
and contre-basse (counter bass). He defines the
registers as follows: ‘By the word register we mean
a series of consecutive and homogeneous tones going
from low to high, produced by the same mechanical

principle, and whose nature differs essentially from
another series of tones equally consecutive and
homogeneous produced by another mechanical
principle. All the tones belonging to the same
register are consequently of the same nature, whatever may be the modifications of timbre or of the
force to which one subjects them’.1 Therefore,
Garcia pioneers the definition of vocal registers in
relation to a given mechanical principle, independently of any timbre variation. In his definition of
vocal registers, the concept of a mechanical principle
prevails over the perceptual dimension. Basing his
rationale on physiological observations of the larynx
position, he demonstrated that the falsetto and head
registers result from the same laryngeal mechanism,
their difference being a timbre effect.2
Nowadays, we have experimental techniques to
which Garcia did not have access at that time. How
has the knowledge about singing voice registers
evolved since Garcia’s time? How are the vocal
registers defined and identified? What are their
physiological, acoustic and perceptual attributes?
By reviewing the historical evolution of the notion
of vocal register, this paper aims to provide a possible

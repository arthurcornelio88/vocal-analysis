**Full reference:**
Roubeau B, Henrich N, Castellengo M. Laryngeal vibratory mechanisms: the notion of vocal register revisited. *J Voice*. 2009;23(4):425-438. doi:10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.10.014

**Occurrences in article (5):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 82) — Introduction
> "...a rigorous interdisciplinary science at the intersection of laryngeal physiology, acoustics, ethnomusicology, and signal engineering."

**Claim supported:** The study of singing voice has become an interdisciplinary science integrating physiology, acoustics, and signal processing.
**Assessment:** General claim. Roubeau et al. (2009) is a foundational paper on laryngeal mechanisms that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of modern vocal science (physiology + acoustics + signal analysis). Appropriate citation. Note: the paper's scope is specifically about laryngeal vibratory mechanisms and vocal registers, not a broad review of the field — but it exemplifies the interdisciplinary approach. *Verified from PDF (Round 3): confirms interdisciplinary methodology combining EGG, acoustics, and physiology.*

### Occurrence 2 (line 200) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "The scientific response to this classification gap lies in the theory of laryngeal vibration mechanisms, established by Roubeau, Henrich, and Castellengo."

**Claim supported:** Attribution of the M0-M3 laryngeal mechanism framework to these authors.
**Assessment:** Correct. This is the seminal paper establishing the four-mechanism framework (M0-M3) based on physiological measurements. Well-established attribution in the field.

### Occurrence 3 (line 219) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "M2 produces lower overall amplitude, energy concentrated in high harmonics, and characteristic phase transitions at register boundaries."

**Claim supported:** Acoustic characteristics of M2 (lower amplitude, energy in high harmonics, phase transitions).
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously cited as henrich2014 (male operatic singers, vocal tract resonances — wrong topic). Now correctly cites roubeau2009, which covers both sexes and directly describes M2 acoustic properties as part of the mechanism framework.

### Occurrence 4 (line 227) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "The choice within this zone is determined not solely by fundamental frequency (f₀) but by desired intensity and timbre."

**Claim supported:** In the M1/M2 overlap zone, mechanism selection depends on intensity and timbre, not just f₀.
**Assessment:** Consistent with the paper's findings about the overlap zone between mechanisms.

### Occurrence 5 (line 527) — Results §4.2
> "...confirming the physiological basis of the G4 passaggio boundary for female voices documented in the literature."

**Claim supported:** The ~400 Hz (G4) boundary for the female voice passaggio is documented in the literature.
**Assessment:** Roubeau et al. (2009) does document frequency ranges for mechanism transitions. The specific ~400 Hz boundary for female voices can be inferred from their data on M1/M2 transition frequencies.
**Assessment:** Roubeau et al. (2009) does document frequency ranges for mechanism transitions. The specific ~400 Hz boundary for female voices can be inferred from their data on M1/M2 transition frequencies.
**Assessment:** Roubeau et al. (2009) does document frequency ranges for mechanism transitions. The specific ~400 Hz boundary for female voices can be inferred from their data on M1/M2 transition frequencies. TODO2: G4 is arbitrary, it's a range, and even fach think in this way (zona de passagio). Rewrite this passage in the article.

## 3. cotton2007

**Full reference:**
Cotton S. Voice Classification and Fach: Usage and Inconsistencies. DMA thesis, University of North Carolina at Greensboro; 2007.

**Occurrences in article (2):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 89) — Introduction
> "...the classification of singing voices in Western pedagogy remains dominated by the German Fach system, a taxonomic framework developed in the 19th century for European opera."

**Claim supported:** The Fach system dominates Western vocal classification and originates from 19th-century European opera.
**Assessment:** Cotton's DMA dissertation specifically examines Fach classification and its inconsistencies. Appropriate citation for the claim about the system's dominance and origins.

### Occurrence 2 (line 187) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "Cotton's doctoral research documented systematic inconsistencies in Fach assignment among professional voice teachers, demonstrating that even within its native operatic context, the system lacks reliability and inter-rater agreement."

**Claim supported:** Professional voice teachers show inconsistencies and low inter-rater agreement in Fach assignment.
**Assessment:** This is the central finding of Cotton's dissertation. [TODO4: confirm that Cotton specifically documents inter-rater disagreement among professional teachers in Fach assignment]

## 5. tatit2002

**Full reference:**
Tatit L. *O Cancionista: composição de canções no Brasil*. São Paulo: EDUSP; 2002.

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 99-101) — Introduction
> "...what Tatit terms *figurativização* — the speech-like quality of Brazilian popular singing that privileges natural articulation over resonant projection."

**Claim supported:** Attribution of the concept of *figurativização* in Brazilian popular singing to Tatit.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously used invented English terms ("colloquial expressivity"). Now uses Tatit's actual term *figurativização* (p. 21, *O Cancionista*), which describes the speech-like quality of Brazilian popular singing — the tension between *fala* (speech) and *canto* (singing). Verified by author against original source.

### Occurrence 2 (line 677-678) — Results §4.5
> "This finding is consistent with Tatit's characterization of Brazilian popular singing as prioritizing *figurativização* — the primacy of speech-like intonation in Brazilian popular song."

**Claim supported:** Brazilian popular singing prioritizes speech-like qualities.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously used "singability of speech." Now uses the correct Portuguese term *figurativização* with an accurate gloss. Verified by author.

### Occurrence 3 (line 717-718) — Discussion §5.1
> "This finding supports Tatit's concept of *figurativização*: the singer prioritizes natural language articulation..."

**Claim supported:** Same concept of speech-like singing quality.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously used "colloquial expressivity." Now consistently uses *figurativização*.

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 101) — Introduction
> "...rapid ornamental passages (glissandi, portamenti), precise diction at high speed, rhythmic agility..."

**Claim supported:** Choro singing demands specific vocal competencies including ornamentation, diction, and rhythmic agility.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously cited as ferraz2010 (wrong author name, wrong year, wrong publication type). The correct source is Rezende (2016), a published book (not a master's thesis) by Daniela Rezende, verified from the book's *ficha catalográfica*. The book specifically covers vocal technique in Choro singing.

### Occurrence 2 (line 109-111) — Introduction
> "The essential vocal competencies of Choro — vocal attack precision, articulatory diction at high speed, ornamental agility, register management, resonance adjustments, and controlled vibrato..."

**Claim supported:** Specific list of Choro vocal competencies.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Both the citation (ferraz2010 → rezende2016) and the competency list were updated. The original list ("respiratory control, diction clarity, sustenance, ornamental agility, precise intonation, effective vocal emission") was replaced with competencies verified from Rezende's book content: vocal attack precision, articulatory diction at high speed, ornamental agility, register management, resonance adjustments, and controlled vibrato. Verified by author against the book.

### Occurrence 3 (line 180) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "Forcing Choro singers into Fach categories leads to reductive 'pigeonholing' that ignores individual 'comfort tessitura' — the range within which a singer achieves optimal articulatory agility and textual intelligibility."

**Claim supported:** The concept of "comfort tessitura" as central to Choro vocal technique.
**Assessment:** Rezende's book discusses vocal technique requirements that imply this concept. The term "comfort tessitura" is the author's interpretive framing of Rezende's practical discussion.

**PDF verified at:** `paper/articles/signals-06-00009.pdf`

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 116) — Introduction
> "XGBoost algorithms optimized by Differential Evolution have achieved vocal register classification accuracy exceeding 97% in controlled settings."

**Claim supported:** XGBoost with evolutionary optimization achieves >97% accuracy in vocal register classification.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously attributed to "Almeida J, et al." — **no author named Almeida exists in this paper**. Real authors: Boratto et al. (8 authors, UFJF/UERJ/UniMi). Claims verified from PDF: XGBoost + DE → 97.60% accuracy (confirmed). Dataset: 350 audio files of a single experienced singer singing the vowel "a" for 6 seconds in 3 registers (chest, mixed, head) in a controlled studio setting. NOT songs, NOT pop music.

### Occurrence 2 (line 137) — Introduction
> "...controlled singing experiments..."

**Claim supported:** ML has been applied to singing register classification in controlled experiments.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously grouped with almeida2025a under "Western pop music" — this was wrong. Boratto et al. is about controlled vowel recordings, not pop music. Text now correctly describes it as "controlled singing experiments."

### Occurrence 3 (line 880) — Conclusion
> "...the evolutionary parameter tuning approach demonstrated by Boratto et al."

**Claim supported:** Reference to evolutionary parameter tuning for potential VMI weight optimization.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously said "Almeida et al." — now correctly attributes to Boratto et al.

**Occurrence in article (1):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 156) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "This capacity depends on the 'singer's formant cluster' — a peak of acoustic energy between 2.5 and 3.5 kHz generated by the convergence of the third, fourth, and fifth vocal tract formants (F₃, F₄, F₅)."

**Claim supported:** The singer's formant is a cluster of energy at 2.5-3.5 kHz from the convergence of F₃, F₄, and F₅.
**Assessment:** This is the seminal paper on the singer's formant. Sundberg (1974) is the canonical reference for this phenomenon. The frequency range and formant convergence description are well-established. [VERIFY: confirm the exact frequency range stated (2.5-3.5 kHz) matches Sundberg's figures — some sources cite 2-4 kHz or 2.5-3.0 kHz]

**Occurrences in article (2):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 166) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "Classifying a Choro voice by its natural acoustic 'weight' ignores the electroacoustic reality inherent to the genre."

**Claim supported:** In amplified genres, acoustic projection criteria are irrelevant.
**Assessment:** Bourne & Garnier (2012) study female music theatre voice, which is also a microphone-dependent genre. [VERIFY: confirm the paper discusses the role of amplification in music theatre and how it changes vocal quality expectations compared to operatic singing]

### Occurrence 2 (line 173) — Theoretical Framework §2.1
> "...popular music singers operate in a flexible 'mixing zone,' using vocal tract adjustments to produce chest voice 'belting' or to bring head voice qualities to lower registers, subverting the fixed transitions assumed by Fach classification."

**Claim supported:** Music theatre/popular singers use a flexible mixing zone with belting and mixed voice techniques that subvert fixed register transitions.
**Assessment:** Bourne & Garnier (2012) examines multiple vocal qualities in music theatre including belt and mix. [VERIFY: confirm the paper specifically discusses the concept of a "mixing zone" and vocal tract adjustments for belting]

**Occurrences in article (4):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 215) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "M1 generates rich harmonic spectra with high spectral energy in low harmonics, typically elevated harmonicity-to-noise ratio (HNR), and strong acoustic projection."

**Claim supported:** Acoustic characteristics of M1 (rich harmonics, high HNR, strong projection).
**Assessment:** Henrich et al. (2004) used EGG to study open quotient and its correlation with laryngeal mechanisms. The paper's focus is on glottal open quotient; the spectral characteristics described may be inferred from the OQ data. [VERIFY: HNR and spectral energy claims may not be explicitly stated in these terms — the paper focuses on OQ]

### Occurrence 2 (line 227) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "The choice within this zone is determined not solely by fundamental frequency (f₀) but by desired intensity and timbre."

**Claim supported:** In the M1/M2 overlap zone, mechanism selection depends on intensity and timbre, not just f₀.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously cited as roubeau2009 + henrich2014. Now cites roubeau2009 + henrich2004. Henrich et al. (2004) studied both male and female singers and directly addresses the relationship between intensity, f₀, and laryngeal mechanism in the overlap zone. Appropriate replacement for henrich2014 (which studied male operatic vocal tract resonances, a different topic).

### Occurrence 3 (line 228) — Theoretical Framework §2.2
> "Henrich et al. demonstrated through EGG measurements that the glottal open quotient (OQ) provides the most reliable differentiation between mechanisms: M1 exhibits lower OQ (longer closed phase, more complete glottal contact), while M2 shows higher OQ (shorter closed phase, reduced contact area)."

**Claim supported:** OQ differentiates M1 (lower OQ) from M2 (higher OQ), as measured by EGG.
**Assessment:** This is a central finding of the paper. The OQ-mechanism relationship is well-established. Appropriate citation.

### Occurrence 4 (line 877) — Conclusion
> "Second, VMI should be validated against electroglottographic (EGG) measurements, which provide direct physiological ground truth for laryngeal mechanism classification."

**Claim supported:** EGG provides ground truth for laryngeal mechanism classification.
**Assessment:** Henrich et al. (2004) is the exemplar of EGG-based mechanism classification. Appropriate citation for establishing EGG as ground truth.

**Occurrence in article (1):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 323) — Methods §3.3
> "Alpha Ratio: the energy ratio (dB) between the high band (1-5 kHz) and the low band (50 Hz-1 kHz). In M1, rapid and firm glottal closure generates strong upper harmonics, producing a high Alpha Ratio. In M2/falsetto, gentle closure concentrates energy in the fundamental, yielding a low ratio."

**Claim supported:** Alpha Ratio definition and its physiological interpretation regarding glottal closure.
**Assessment:** VERIFIED. Sundberg & Nordenberg (2006) defines "the alpha measure" as the ratio of energy above and below 1 kHz in LTAS. The 1000 Hz split point is confirmed correct. Our exact band limits (50 Hz lower bound, 5 kHz upper bound) are implementation-specific but defensible as standard spectral analysis bounds. The M1/M2 interpretation (glottal closure → spectral balance) is an extrapolation from Sundberg's concept but is physiologically grounded. No change needed.

**Occurrences in article (3):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 328) — Methods §3.3
> "H₁-H₂: the amplitude difference (dB) between the first harmonic (H₁ = f₀) and the second harmonic (H₂ = 2f₀), the most direct acoustic correlate of the glottal adduction pattern."

**Claim supported:** H₁-H₂ as acoustic correlate of glottal adduction.
**Assessment:** Hanson (1997) is a key paper on H₁-H₂ as a voice quality measure. The connection between H₁-H₂ and glottal characteristics (breathiness, adduction) is well-established in this paper.

### Occurrence 2 (line 333-335) — Methods §3.3
> "A known limitation is that in the upper register, H₁ may coincide with the first vocal tract resonance (F₁), contaminating the measurement."

**Claim supported:** H₁-H₂ measurement is unreliable when H₁ approaches F₁.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously stated a specific "approximately 350 Hz" threshold attributed to Hanson. Research confirmed that Hanson (1997) discusses the H₁-F₁ interaction principle but does not state a specific 350 Hz threshold. Text softened to "in the upper register" — the principle is correct, the specific number was removed.

### Occurrence 3 (line 834-835) — Discussion §5.3 (Limitations)
> "In the upper register, the first harmonic (H₁) may coincide with the first vocal tract resonance (F₁), contaminating the H₁-H₂ measurement."

**Claim supported:** Same H₁-F₁ interaction limitation.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Same softening applied — removed specific "350 Hz" threshold, kept the principle.

> "Spectral Tilt: the slope of the linear regression fitted to the power spectrum (log-frequency vs. amplitude in dB) in the 50-5,000 Hz range."

**Claim supported:** Spectral tilt as a measure of spectral energy decay.
**Assessment:** Fant (1995) discusses the LF-model of glottal flow, which is directly related to spectral tilt. The LF-model parameters determine the spectral envelope slope. Appropriate foundational citation.

### Occurrence 2 (line 778) — Discussion §5.2
> "...the underlying physics of glottal closure is mechanism-dependent, not frequency-dependent."

**Claim supported:** Glottal closure physics (spectral tilt) depends on mechanism, not absolute frequency.
**Assessment:** The LF-model describes glottal behavior independently of f₀. [VERIFY: confirm that this frequency-independence claim is supported or can be inferred from Fant's LF-model description]

**Occurrences in article (2):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 375) — Methods §3.4
> "...trained on GMM-generated pseudo-labels, an established technique in semi-supervised learning."

**Claim supported:** Pseudo-labeling is an established semi-supervised learning technique.
**Assessment:** Lee (2013) is the foundational paper on pseudo-labels. Correct citation.

### Occurrence 2 (line 800) — Discussion §5.3 (Limitations)
> "The perfect classification accuracy (F₁ = 1.00) reflects the high separability of GMM clusters in the nine-dimensional feature space, not validated physiological accuracy. XGBoost cannot, on average, be more accurate than its pseudo-labels, and inherits any systematic errors from the GMM (confirmation bias)."

**Claim supported:** Pseudo-label circularity limitation — classifier inherits label generator errors.
**Assessment:** This is a well-known limitation of pseudo-labeling discussed in Lee (2013) and the broader semi-supervised literature. Appropriate citation.

**Occurrence in article (1):**

### Occurrence 1 (line 375) — Methods §3.4
> "...an established technique in semi-supervised learning."

**Claim supported:** Semi-supervised learning using unlabeled data (supporting citation alongside lee2013).
**Assessment:** Nigam et al. (2000) is a foundational paper on using EM with labeled and unlabeled data. While it specifically uses EM for text classification (not pseudo-labels per se), the connection is that both methods leverage unlabeled data. The citation is slightly tangential but defensible as foundational semi-supervised learning work.

### Occurrence 1 (line 685) — Results §4.5
> "...a competency that Behlau and Ziemer identify as essential for Brazilian popular singing but that has no equivalent criterion in the Fach system."

**Claim supported:** Textual intelligibility is identified as essential for Brazilian popular singing.
**Assessment:** CORRECTED. Previously listed as @book "Voz: o livro do especialista" (Revinter, Rio de Janeiro) — this conflated two different works. The correct source is Behlau & Ziemer (1988), a book chapter titled "Psicodinâmica vocal" in *Trabalhando a Voz* (ed. Ferreira), published by Summus (São Paulo). This is a different work from Behlau's later solo-authored "Voz: o livro do especialista" (2001, Revinter). Entry changed from @book to @incollection with correct metadata.

This article presents the results of glottal open-quotient measurements in the case of singing voice
production. It explores the relationship between open quotient and laryngeal mechanisms, vocal
intensity, and fundamental frequency. The audio and electroglottographic signals of 18 classically
trained male and female singers were recorded and analyzed with regard to vocal intensity,
fundamental frequency, and open quotient. Fundamental frequency and open quotient are derived
from the differentiated electroglottographic signal, using the DECOM 共DEgg Correlation-based
Open quotient Measurement兲 method. As male and female phonation may differ in respect to
vocal-fold vibratory properties, a distinction is made between two different glottal configurations,

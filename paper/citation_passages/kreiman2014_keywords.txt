unified theory of voice production and perception. Loquens, 1(1), e009. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/loquens.2014.009

ABSTRACT: At present, two important questions about voice remain unanswered: When voice quality changes, what
physiological alteration caused this change, and if a change to the voice production system occurs, what change in
perceived quality can be expected? We argue that these questions can only be answered by an integrated model of

evidence in support of this approach is also presented. We conclude that development of such a model should be a
priority for scientists interested in voice, to explain what physical condition(s) might underlie a given voice quality,
or what voice quality might result from a specific physical configuration.

studies address the manner in which information is
transmitted from one stage to the next, much less from
one end of this chain to the other. As a result, two important questions about voice remain unanswered: 1)
When voice quality changes in some way, what caused
the change? and 2) If a change occurs in voice production, what will be the resulting perceived change in
quality? In this paper, we motivate a model of voice that

aerodynamic, and acoustic causes (see Titze, 1994, for
review). Thus, these studies have not resulted in any
significant insight into voice production or perception,
because questions about causation are difficult to answer

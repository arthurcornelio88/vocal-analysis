This ‘‘smoothing’’ technique can be used by any skilled

In this study, 18 trained male and female singers were

This article presents the results of glottal open-quotient measurements in the case of singing voice
production. It explores the relationship between open quotient and laryngeal mechanisms, vocal
intensity, and fundamental frequency. The audio and electroglottographic signals of 18 classically

show that open quotient depends on the laryngeal mechanisms. It ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 in
mechanism 1 and from 0.5 to 0.95 in mechanism 2. The open quotient is strongly related to vocal

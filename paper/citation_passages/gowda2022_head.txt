ABSTRACT Formant tracking is investigated in this study by using trackers based on dynamic programming (DP) and deep neural nets (DNNs). Using the DP approach, six formant estimation methods were
first compared. The six methods include linear prediction (LP) algorithms, weighted LP algorithms and
the recently developed quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) method. QCP-FB gave the best
performance in the comparison. Therefore, a novel formant tracking approach, which combines benefits
of deep learning and signal processing based on QCP-FB, was proposed. In this approach, the formants
predicted by a DNN-based tracker from a speech frame are refined using the peaks of the all-pole spectrum
computed by QCP-FB from the same frame. Results show that the proposed DNN-based tracker performed
better both in detection rate and estimation error for the lowest three formants compared to reference formant
trackers. Compared to the popular Wavesurfer, for example, the proposed tracker gave a reduction of 29%,
48% and 35% in the estimation error for the lowest three formants, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

of VTRs is an important and necessary computational block.

Estimation and tracking of formant frequencies is an important research topic in several areas of speech science
and technology [1]–[6]. During the past few decades, many
techniques have been proposed for formant tracking [7]–
[10]. These algorithms typically consist of two parts, the
estimation stage and the tracking stage. In the former, initial
estimates of the vocal tract resonances (VTRs) are computed
in short frames (e.g., 25 ms) using spectral estimation methods such as linear prediction (LP). In the latter, the formants estimated from individual frames are expressed using
contours which cover a longer unit (e.g., word or sentence)
[7], [8]. In addition, estimation and tracking can be done

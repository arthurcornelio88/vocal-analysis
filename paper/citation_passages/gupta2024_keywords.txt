ABSTRACT
Introduction Over the past decade, several machine
learning (ML) algorithms have been investigated to assess
their efficacy in detecting voice disorders. Literature

INTRODUCTION
Voice disorders are defined as deviations
from the voice quality, pitch and loudness

processing algorithms and environmental factors that
affect the efficacy of those algorithms.
Methods We will search the following databases: Web

The aim of this review is to identify the key obstacles
that have prevented the widespread adoption of ML algorithms in voice disorder recognition in clinical practice by
examining the methodologies, processes and outcomes
reported in the literature.
Review questions

Additional questions are included to address the testing
methodology, availability of experimental codes, existence of baseline model implementations and the comparison between the various input features used in existing
ML systems. A full list of questions that are intended to
be addressed by this review are provided in online supplemental appendix I.
